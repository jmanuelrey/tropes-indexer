It takes a surprising amount of resources, and some companies cut corners to save on expenses. There's also the ethics issues brought up by animal rights groups. However, meat is so delicious, important and full of protein that it's hard to give up.\n\nWe actually have some ideas right now . Basically we take some species' cell culture and grow it into something edible. Since you don't need to raise animals, there's no question of inhumane treatment because what you've eaten never had a brain, hence why meat produced in this procedure is also known as \"cruelty free meat\". It likely isn't nearly as ecologically impacting given that the meat has far fewer bodily functions to maintain, also reducing the resource cost.\n\nAt least in theory. In practice, it's a bit difficult to get the meat to grow like that, but we've definitely made some progress. Fictionland assumes we've overcome these hurdles or found some other workaround.\n\nLess realistic Artificial Meat can be made by way of Matter Replicators.\n\nNote: Since all that's required is a genetic sample, it is not beyond reason to suggest that you might one day be able to eat cultivated meat of extinct species. Ever wanted to taste a mammoth? Or a dinosaur? When you stop to think about it, one of the more Squicky implications of this is that you can get humanely cultivated flesh of sapient beings - or yourself!\n\nSubtrope of Future Food Is Artificial.
