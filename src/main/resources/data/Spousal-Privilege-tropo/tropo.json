One of the results of this, when mixed with another old legal concept (you could not testify at your own trial), was that a wife could not testify for or against her husband. As the rules regarding legal personage and testimony changed, this turned into a rule that one spouse could not give adverse testimony against the other. Over the course of the 20th century, this rule has continued to change, generally transforming into a sort of privilege for certain communications.\n\nCurrently, in U.S. federal courts (other nations' courts and State courts frequently have a different, typically lesser, degree of protection), two spousal privileges exist:\n\u2022 Marital confidences privilege: Any private conversation between spouses during the marriage, even if the two are later divorced, is not admissible as evidence, unless both allow its admission. There are exceptions to this; for example if both spouses are parties to a criminal conspiracy they can't invoke privilege to hide their conversations in furtherance of it.\n\u2022 Spousal testimonial privilege: If one spouse is on trial, the other cannot be compelled to testify against the one on trial. \"Compelled\" is important here; if the spouse wants to testify against their partner, they are free to do so. Note that this is considerably different from other sorts of legally recognized privileges. In those cases, the party the information is adverse to has the control. Unlike the Marital confidences privilege, the two have to be married at the time, but this privilege also covers things before marriage.\n\nIf they are on opposite sides of the lawsuit, such as in divorce proceedings, child custody, or when one is the plaintiff and the other is the defendant, all spousal privilege is suspended (otherwise there wouldn't be much that could be said during the trial).\n\nWhen this is used in fiction, it tends to be ... broadly used to say that the other spouse can't be a witness, even if they want to be (note that it was true for some time in the past in some jurisdictions (including UK), but definitely not anymore, except in some strict interpretations of Sharia law).", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpousalPrivilege", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheTwilightZone", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheCloneSaga", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AngelFace", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCaseOfTheCuriousBride", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PerryMason", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/InOldChicago", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ASongIsBorn", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManFromKangaroo", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordPeterWimsey", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DorothyLSayers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AgathaChristie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BrightonRock", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SidneySheldon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Weeds", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheSopranos", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ArrestedDevelopment", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MurderOne", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCloser", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DowntonAbbey", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoardwalkEmpire", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Castle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWholeTruth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodPlace", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodWife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Facepalm", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoundEffectBleep", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDungAges", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Islam", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmicTwistEnding", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarWars", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ElementalChessTrilogy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllegalGuardian", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/LasVegas", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPartner", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Averted", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrusadingLawyer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TakesAThirdOption", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AlCapone", "http://chicagocrimescenes.blogspot.com/2009/04/lookout-nest-for-st-valentines-day.html", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FellOffTheBackOfATruck"]}
