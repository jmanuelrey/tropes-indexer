Maybe said character has a heart that is too small and thus cannot properly love or maybe their brain resembles the size of a golf ball and thus lacks normal intelligence. Of course, having an organ this small in Real Life would cause serious complications for most of these characters, so this trope is very often Played for Laughs.\n\nThat being said, there are numerous examples of this trope being played seriously as well, typically in the Medical Drama or Soap Opera realm. While cases of super-small organs in those works are still factually inaccurate, they are at least portrayed in a semi-realistic sense. For example, this trope could be invoked by a character born with some form of congenital heart defect where their heart is too small and will cause their death unless a replacement is found.\n\nAs this trope greatly exaggerates real body parts, it is a natural subtrope of Artistic License \u0096 Biology.\n\nNot under any circumstances to be mistaken for Teeny Weenie.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrunkenOrgan", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/AladdinTheReturnOfJafar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HowTheGrinchStoleChristmas", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DrSeuss", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HowTheGrinchStoleChristmas", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DragonHalf", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Planetary", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/AladdinTheReturnOfJafar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAmazingColossalMan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OsmosisJones", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HowTheGrinchStoleChristmas", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JustSayJulie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HorribleHistories", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MontyPythonsFlyingCircus", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RenAndStimpy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PinkyAndTheBrain", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CowAndChicken", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BuckarooBugs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodenameKidsNextDoor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheVentureBrothers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonkeyKongCountry"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedicalDrama", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeenyWeenie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtisticLicenseBiology", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePolice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoEvenNeedsABrain", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleSequence", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheWriter", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalloweenEpisode", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreakyFridayFlip", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncredibleShrinkingMan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyBrainIsBig"]}
