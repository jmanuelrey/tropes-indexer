{"title": "Pro-Human Transhuman", "content": "Kiriya Kujo is killed fairly early in the series by Kuroto Dan, and much later on he's revived as a Bugster (essentially a living computer virus). While it looks like he's undergone a Face\u0096Heel Turn at first, it turns out he was just faking it, and jumps ship to the good guys as soon as he steals something important away from the Big Bad . Kuroto is also killed and resurrected, but remains a complete prick with a major God complex ; technically he's on humanity's side, mainly because he hates the other side more. Together they end up developing an important vaccine that helps bring down the Big Bad , and at the end of the series they're still Bugsters and still with the heroes.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProhumanTranshuman", "media_links": [], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad"]}
