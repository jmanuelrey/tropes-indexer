{"title": "Phoning The Phantom", "content": "In stories with ghosts or fairies or other things that only certain people can see or hear, an extremely common source of comedy is how absolutely ridiculous and awkward this looks to everyone else. There have been far too many protagonists who forget who they're talking to and make hilariously out-of-context outbursts seemingly out of nowhere while surrounded by strangers.\n\nA handful of characters, however, have discovered an interesting solution. Because there's already a perfectly understandable situation where humans talk to people no-one else can see or hear: when they're on the phone.\n\nThe plan is simple: grab a phone or stick a Bluetooth headset in your ear, and then just talk to your inaudible friend while pretending they're the person on the other end of the call. Presto! Suddenly you don't look like a total weirdo who's talking to an imaginary friend.\n\nNot to be confused with Phone Call from the Dead. See also Phoney Call, a bluff where you lie about who (if anyone) you're on the phone with.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhoningThePhantom", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jekyll", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DuskMaidenOfAmnesia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/JojosBizarreAdventureVentoAureo", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Persona3", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PokemonDetectivePikachu", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BeingHumanUS", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Jekyll", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QuantumLeap", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheAdventuresOfWiglafAndMordred"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonality", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhoneCallFromTheDead", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhoneyCall", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SplitPersonalities", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheManyWorldsInterpretation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreepyChild", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/FairlyEnglishStory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokemonSpeak", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hologram", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvisibleToNormals"]}
