{"title": "Taxonomic Term Confusion", "content": "Taxonomy, the classification of living things, is really complicated. For example, anyone who's worked in a record store and had to fit every band into one neat little category or other has an idea as to why: Many organisms defy traditional or obvious categories in the absence of genetic studies. This is why there is such a wide variety of terms for organizing living things (and theoreticians regularly come up with new ones).\n\nWriters of fiction tend to tidy things up a bit. They regularly come up with creative ways of employing normal classification terms in ways that are incredibly inappropriate. Primarily, what seems to be at fault is a failure to recognize that the terms for taxonomic categories have specific meanings, and are not just interchangeable synonyms for \"a big group of similar things\". Sometimes they do know better; it's just that they couldn't resist the Beast Fable pun of having an Animal Kingdom. You know, where the lion is the King.\n\nFor the record, any group of related organisms, regardless of the degree of relatedness, is called a taxon. The major recognized taxonomic ranks are:\n\u2022 Phylum (division in botany; the division goes directly beneath the class in zoology)\n\nEvery species past and present is part of all of these, in a nested pattern. So a given kingdom will contain one or more phyla, which each contain one or more classes, etc. Although some phenomena (like horizontal gene transfer and hybridization) muddy this a bit, in general there is no overlap. In a way, as huge and diverse as life is, it can be easier to classify than records. (A band can create a hard-to-sort genre like \"folktronica\", but fish and birds can't have babies or otherwise be combined to make a new taxon \u0097 yet.) The demarcations just aren't as obvious, in part thanks to the granularity (as if every band was accompanied by hundreds of extremely similar bands, and the music itself was the only source material for data).\n\nCompound variations on these terms such as \"subspecies\" and \"superfamily\" are in common use. Some taxonomists also make use of the term \"tribe\" for a rank intermediate between subfamily and genus. This is not just limited to fiction; in a strictly factual sense birds are technically reptiles, and the whole animal/plant/fungus distinction is being rewritten of late so more often than not, it's hard to know the correct terminology because it's always changing. It doesn't help matters that the current system was invented before evolution was understood, and that the ranks are pretty arbitrary. One \"genus\" might be older and more diverse than another \"family.\" Some scientists even want to abolish taxonomic ranks .\n\nAnother important distinction is whether a named group is monophyletic (\"one tree\") or not. A monophyletic group is exactly all descendants of some ancestor species. One way to think of phylogenetics and cladistics is they are the determination of which groups are monophyletic. All groups with a taxonomic rank (e.g. a genus) should be monophyleticnote hence these groupings are constantly under revision as new evidence about monophyly is discovered, but commonly used group names may not be \u0097 e.g. \"monkey\" is not monophyletic unless you consider humans and other apes to also be monkeys, as Old World monkeys are more closely related to apes than New World monkeys are. How to deal with this is debatable, and indeed debated in the examples on this very page. Some would argue that \"monkey\" must include humans, others that \"monkeys\" are not a legitimate group, others that \"monkey\" is useful and legitimate, but you just need to be aware it is not monophyletic.\n\nThe scientific Latin name for a species consists of the genus name (capitalized), followed by the species name (in all lower case), both italicised. Tyrannosaurus rex is genus Tyrannosaurus, species rex; Homo sapiens is genus Homo, species sapiens. If the species is well known, or has already been mentioned earlier in the same work, the genus name will frequently be abbreviated to a single letter, e.g. T. rex or H. sapiens. If more hairsplitting is needed, the subspecies or variety name can be appended as a third word, e.g. Homo sapiens sapiens.\n\nFrankly, it's not surprising that writers are sometimes ignorant or confused. Though this can also turn into a case of Fan Wank as many of these words also have different less precise meanings in regular English as in family and class are both used to refer to groups of similar things, a class of ships, the t-series family of trucks so a lot of these errors are just people using the words with their regular meanings. But there's really no excuse for such errors when they're committed by scientists who work in zoology and other fields that explicitly require them to be well-versed in how the nomenclature works.\n\nOf course, things are also more complicated than even this.
