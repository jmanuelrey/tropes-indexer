{"title": "Kids Hate Grownups' Conversations", "content": "So a kid is with some adult, often a parent or other kind of guardian, and said adult is having a conversation with another adult. The kid wants to get out of there, and might ask said adults to cut the conversation short, or alternatively, might go off on his or her own for a little while depending on their age and circumstances.\n\nPerhaps the kid feels the need to be somewhere in particular at a time and does not want to be delayed by the conversation. Perhaps the kid just does not find the conversation interesting and is becoming impatient. Whatever the reason, the kid wants to either get out of there or cut the chat short, because kids hate grownups' conversations.\n\nTruth in Television, of course.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidsHateGrownupsConversations", "media_links": ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LittleMissSunshine", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur"], "non_media_links": ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContentWarnings", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeadphonesEqualIsolation", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin"]}
