{"title": "Sudden School Uniform", "content": "In Real Life, if a school is planning a major change of Dress Code, particularly if they're going all the way from \"no shirt, no shoes, no service\" to a strict uniform policy, they will announce it well in advance, seeking consultation from parents, teachers, the community at large if it's a public school, and often students, with any changes to take effect at the start of the following school year. (This applies to most other major policy changes, too. Schools are run by bureaucracies, and bureaucracy tends to move ponderously.)\n\nNot so in fictionland. Maybe the Reasonable Authority Figure has been replaced by someone less reasonable, maybe the principal just snapped, maybe it's coming down from above, but the fictional school now has uniforms. With a day's notice, a week's notice at most. The resolution of the episode will lead to them being abolished since Status Quo Is God, usually reverting to No Dress Code at all.\n\nOften found within a Tyrant Takes the Helm plotline and Anti-School Uniforms Plot. Primarily seen in American series, since it needs, on the one hand, a serial medium, such as television, and on the other a cultural backdrop in which school uniforms exist as an option note Technically they aren't an option in the United States, at least for traditional district-run public schools, but there are ways of getting around this in Real Life, and fiction writers, of course, are free to ignore all of it but are the exception rather than the norm. This is something of a compressed variant of SoCalization since most middle schools in Los Angeles have uniforms but they're far less common at both the elementary and High School level.
