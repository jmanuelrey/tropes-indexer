{"title": "Roaring Rampage of Romance", "content": "Alice loves Bob, and Bob loves Alice. But then, it would be too easy if it was this easy: for some reason, Alice and Bob cannot be left to live happy together. Sometimes, this leads to Love Makes You Crazy, when Bob stops acting rationally to stay with Alice. Sometimes, Bob decides to take care of this annoying guy who claims he wants to just be Alice's friend. Sometimes, Alice decides to torture and murder all of Bob's female friends so he won't be distracted by all these, well... Sometimes, Bob coldly decides to sacrifice his True Companions to save Alice.\n\nThis is none of these situations. This is when Alice and Bob stay, most of the time, level headed and genuinely try their best to be together, and notwithstanding their success or failure, the Collateral Damage is at least 147 deaths, the destruction of three cities, and maybe even the End of the World as We Know It. Even if it can involve some irrationality (after all, Love Makes You Crazy or sometimes evil), it's not the characters' flaws, but the circumstances that force the couple to go to extreme length to be together. Or, even worse, they didn't even realize what they were doing, and the couple's stubborn insistence on being together results in an unintended ripple effect of death and destruction. In short, this trope is not about characterization, it is about the effects of a relationship on the story and the setting.\n\nCan involve Love Makes You Evil or Love Makes You Crazy. This is an inversion of Destructo-Nookie where the rampage part involves only the couple, and usually does not leave the bedroom.\n\nThis is a trope about how romance can be really, really destructive. That's just what happens when you place the huge power of love into the hands of someone in love. They become irrational, and mad with power. Expect at least one case of Murder the Hypotenuse, especially if there is a Yandere involved.\n\nThe Trope Namer is Love Actually, by way of its tagline, though it's not an example.\n\nRelated to Love Makes You Evil and Love Makes You Crazy. Also related to Destructo-Nookie and Outlaw Couple. Sometimes caused by Always Save the Girl.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRomance", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LoveActually", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TsubasaReservoirChronicle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/X1999", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/UminekoWhenTheyCry", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheSandman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMonk", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Twilight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/RomeoAndJuliet", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/RichardWagner", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WhatsOperaDoc", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Tannhaeuser", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DerRingDesNibelungen", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/AntonyAndCleopatra", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OdinSphere", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/DerRingDesNibelungen"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepartmentOfRedundancyDepartment", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheoryOfNarrativeCausality", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tragedy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CollateralDamage", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndOfTheWorldAsWeKnowIt", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceJobBreakingItHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructoNookie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MurderTheHypotenuse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tagline", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouEvil", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveMakesYouCrazy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DestructoNookie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutlawCouple", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysSaveTheGirl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yandere", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KidWithTheLeash", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralEventHorizon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperMarioBros", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToHellAndBack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannotSpitItOut"]}
