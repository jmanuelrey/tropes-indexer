{"title": "Defcon Five", "content": "In some movies, the phrase \"Defcon 5\" or Defense Readiness Condition 5 is used to refer to the highest state of alert for the United States Armed Forces.\n\nThis is incorrect, and this trope is about the misuse of these terms. DEFCON 5 (codename \"FADE OUT\"note These codenames are used during exercises to avoid confusion with the real deal) is the lowest state of alert, aka completely tranquil peace time. DEFCON 1 (codename \"COCKED PISTOL\") is the highest, referring to a confirmed state of nuclear war. The use of nuclear weapons is authorized here, but they will still require unlock codes from high authority. The highest state reached for the Strategic Air Command in US history was DEFCON 2 (codename \"FAST PACE\", during the Cuban Missile Crisis), the Gulf War also led to forces in the Middle East reaching DEFCON 2, for obvious reasons \u0097 i.e., actually being at war. The Yom Kippur War of 1973 saw a brief period at DEFCON 3 (codename \"ROUND HOUSE\", with some forces in the Middle East being at 2), as did 9/11. It's important to note that DEFCON levels can be limited to geographical regions, DEFCON 2 during the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Gulf War were limited to the affected regions. The highest that the worldwide DEFCON level has ever risen to is 3.\n\nThe UK did once operate a \"Queen's Order\" level which escalated from 1 to 5, QO1 being the peacetime default and QO5 meaning (at the time) that the V-bombers had started their [probably] one way trip to enemy territory. The current system, dubbed the UK Threat Levels, doesn't use numbers at all, instead ranking the current likelihood of attack on a scale from Low to Critical (its most recent predecessor, the now-defunct BIKINI scale, used colours). However, these levels do not correspond to US Defcon levels - for example, the UK reached a \"critical\" Threat Level in 2006 and 2007. Thus, there is currently no real UK equivalent. Other countries have their own status levels, in some cases where this trope is played straight, in others they use phrases or colours instead.\n\u2022 DEFCON 5: Lowest state of readiness \u0097 this is the normal state of readiness in peacetime. Code name: FADE OUT\n\u2022 DEFCON 4: Increased intelligence watch and strengthened security measures. Code Name: DOUBLE TAKE seems that someone in the military had an odd sense of humor\n\u2022 DEFCON 3: Increase in force readiness above that required for normal readiness. Air Force ready to mobilize in 15 minutes \u0097 this is the first truly \"shit is about to get real\" phase of the levels. Code Name: ROUND HOUSE\n\u2022 DEFCON 2: War is imminent. Armed Forces ready to deploy and engage in less than 6 hours \u0097 this is the highest level ever reached in history This would have been during the Cuban Missile Crisis on October 22, 1962. Only the Strategic Air Command (the nuclear bombers) were at DEFCON 2, the rest of the military was maintained at DEFCON 3 throughout the crisis . Code Name: FAST PACE\n\nIt should be pointed out that alert levels mean different things to different forces. An armoured division in the US is going to take several weeks at best to move and engage an enemy (unless the Russians are hitting Long Island right now), even at DEFCON 1. On the other hand, Nuclear Missile forces; designed to launch at a moment's notice are essentially at DEFCON 1 at all times; even if the current status is DEFCON 5.\n\nCompare with The War on Terror, for the color system that is often parodied for its vagueness.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefconFive", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossPlus", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/EightOhOneTTSAirbats", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JusticeLeagueOfAmerica", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheDCU", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheAvengers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BeavisAndButtHeadDoAmerica", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InsideOut", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/UltimateAvengers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HowToLoseAGuyIn10Days", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UndercoverBrother", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CanadianBacon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Defcon4", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Transformers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ByDawnsEarlyLight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Cryptonomicon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAdventuresOfPeteAndPete", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ByAnyMeans", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChicagoFire", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Chuck", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MadMen", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOfficeUS", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Tremors", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/NoxArcana", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Newgrounds", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CheapTrick", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Megadeth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GoodOmens", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/TheYoungTurks", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RonWhite", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CriticalPath", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/UniverseAtWar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/RoomiesItsWalkyJoyceAndWalky", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Fans", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomClancy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GhostRecon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XMenEvolution"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsufferableGenius", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticGunCock", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClickHello", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_bombers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleTake", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GallowsHumor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOnTerror", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityWarper", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedAlert", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AvertedTrope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SmallReferencePools", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeBrilliance", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshaded", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractingDisambiguation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS30E5ThePoisonSky", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReadingsAreOffTheScale", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffTheScale", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerMetal", "http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/1975", "https://www.q-dance.com/global/home", "https://defqon1.nl/en", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TechTree", "http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/267776", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Crossover", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Webcomic", "http://www.itswalky.com/d/20030508.html", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StripArchive", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Unskippable", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terror_Alert_Level", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/RonaldReagan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOutOfHere"]}
