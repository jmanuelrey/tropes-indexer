{"title": "Standard Hollywood Strafing Procedure", "content": "Strafing is the act of attacking surface targets from the air with something other than bombs, guided missiles or a long, continuous energy blast. One might think that a bullet fired from an aircraft at a target on the ground, if it misses (which would likely be the case, unless the pilot was a good shot, the target was rather large, etc.), would likely strike the ground well beyond the target.\n\nIn Real Life, it's not so simple, as the type of target, the aircraft type, the pilot's experience, and nearby defenses or other targets (such as civilians) in the area, can all come into play. And if the aircraft is fast enough you won't even realize it's attacking until it's done and gone.\n\nIn Hollywood, it does not work that way. The Rule of Cool and the Rule of Drama dictate a more theatrical methodology:\n\u2022 The aircraft turns until it is lined up with the road, beach, dock, etc.\n\u2022 The aircraft descends slowly and menacingly while its engine gets very loud and high in pitch, resembling a Stuka dive bomber, giving its victims plenty of time to realize THEY are the target.\n\u2022 You may see muzzle flashes and hear machine gun noises.\n\u2022 A pattern of bullets hits the ground between the target and the strafing aircraft and moves toward the target.\n\u2022 If the aircraft has dual machine guns, the bullet pattern will be two parallel lines, usually wide enough to be on each side of a road.\n\u2022 If the aircraft does NOT have dual machine guns, the bullet pattern may STILL be two parallel lines, usually wide enough to be on each side of a road, just to give the good guys a sporting chance.\n\u2022 The bullet impact will either cause puffs of dirt to erupt from the ground or cause ricochets off solid objects.\n\u2022 In a war drama, lighthearted action movie, etc:\n\u2022 More intelligent characters abandon vehicles and throw themselves in a ditch or into foliage alongside the road.\n\u2022 Less intelligent vehicle drivers try to dodge the bullets.\n\u2022 Easily replacable Red Shirts and Mooks freeze in horror or run about randomly and are cut down.\n\u2022 In a comedy, characters try to outrun the bullets or dodge them by dancing.\n\nHistorically movies portrayed strafing unrealistically because it was safe and easy. Set off a couple of lines of small charges in the sand running toward the target, far enough apart to not endanger the stunt crew, and the audience cannot fail to get the point. It's simple, cheap, straightforward, and the inexorably approaching danger significantly raises the dramatic tension. Also, some of this is Truth in Television, as 'walking' shots up to the target helps to ensure you actually get a hit, though in reality (as seen in the Real Life Examples below) the strike pattern is usually less a steady progression than a cloud of \"shorts\" and \"overs\"\u2014firing from an inherently unstable platform means aircraft guns aren't particularly steady or accurate.\n\nShowing the path of devastation wrought by the likes of the P-47D's eight .50 cal machine guns would be much more difficult, expensive, dangerous and confusing, and the likely results would not be suitable for most audiences. The guns were individually aimed at a single point of intersection a certain distance in front of the plane (think about it - if the guns weren't turned slightly inward so that the shots converged, planes would have trouble with air combat as they'd end up missing targets to both the left and right at the same time). They were also far too powerful to waste on a single individual. These planes were said to be capable of sawing fully grown trees in half on a strafing run. Pilots described train cars being pushed over, and horses being thrown 30 feet, by the sheer kinetic impact. Not that a pilot would be likely to see a single person on the ground in any case. Without spotters on the ground in radio contact pilots would strafe vehicles, roads, trains, or large obvious targets.\n\nOne last thing: if the strafers are Eeeeeevil, the probability of one of the strafees being an adorable little tyke who drops a teddy bear approaches 100%.\n\nSubtrope of Near Misses, Sister Trope to Hollywood Tactics.
