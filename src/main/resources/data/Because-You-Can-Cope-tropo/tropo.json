{"title": "Because You Can Cope", "content": "A character is abandoned, neglected, or thrown to the wolves by someone they love and trust, because said caretaker decided to look after someone else. There are two main variations of this trope:\n\u2022 Abandonment at a critical point: Alice is in the middle of a battle alongside her mentor, Bob, and Bob's other apprentice, Charlie. Usually, Alice is the more powerful or competent of the apprentices \u2014 she gets into much less trouble than Charlie. However, on this single occasion, Alice is unlucky. Not to worry, though \u2014 Bob will rescue her! After all, he's always bailing Charlie out of trouble, isn't he? He'd never fail his apprentice! Except...as Alice screams for help, she catches sight of Bob and Charlie \u2014 and they're fleeing the battlefield. If Charlie is in any way sympathetic, he will protest leaving Alice to her fate, only for Bob to tell him \"Leave her!\" Alice blacks out, bewildered and betrayed. If she has been struggling before, the sight of her friends turning their backs on her will break her spirit and she may give up.\n\u2022 Ongoing Neglect: David and Emily are siblings. David is perfectly healthy, but Emily is an Ill Girl. Their parents are constantly attending to Emily, bundling her up against the cold, making emergency hospital trips, taking time off work to look after her when she's ill, and generally worrying about her. In all the fuss, however, David is practically forgotten \u2014 his mother and father expect him to look after himself, since he doesn't technically need as much care as Emily does. However, should he start misbehaving or, worse, voice resentment about Emily's monopoly of his parents' time, expect a massive guilt trip of the \"you don't know how lucky you are\" variety.\n\nSomehow, Alice escapes her captors and David manages to survive childhood. Unsurprisingly, however, they are less than happy with the person who failed them. If they are The Stoic or The Woobie, they probably won't make a fuss \u2014 the Stoic because (s)he sees complaining as a sign of weakness, the Woobie because... well, it's part of that \"suffering beautifully\" thing. However, other characters may opt for Calling the Old Man Out.\n\nHow does the \"Old Man\" justify himself? \"I abandoned you because I knew you could cope.\" Or, \"I had faith in your abilities.\" Or, more bluntly, \"Your [insert relevant relation or friend here] needed me more.\"\n\nThis reaction can be perfectly justified. The mentor may have had to make a Sadistic Choice, and chosen the course of action most likely to get everyone out alive. It's also inevitable that a sick child is going to demand more attention than a healthy one. This does not make it any more pleasant for the character who was left out in the cold, but it prevents the audience from losing sympathy with the parent/mentor. Other situations are less defensible \u2014 for example, Charlie has clearly been Bob's favourite all along, or Emily is not actually sick, just a Spoiled Brat who feigns illness to get attention. (Though, the latter case still prevents the loss of audience sympathy if the neglecters are hoodwinked.)\n\nThis trope sees more capable or better-natured characters getting the short end of the stick, because they are always expected to look after themselves (and, often, other people as well) while their parent/mentor/friend goes haring after their more vulnerable or stupid associates. If the target of Because You Can Cope can't cope in one particular instance (usually having to rescue themselves or be saved by a third party), others may claim it was because the victim was weak, not because they were let down.\n\nSometimes the parent/mentor gets away with their act of abandonment with no ill consequences. However, Alice in particular may be prone to a Face\u0096Heel Turn, eventually attacking those who left her to die. Even David might decide to deny help when his parents or sister need it, as payback for years of neglect. This may be an act of Laser-Guided Karma or proof of David/Alice's descent to evil, depending on the lesson the writer is shooting for.\n\nThere is a Heroic Sacrifice version of this trope, where a character volunteers to take one for the team because they are better equipped to deal with a bad situation \u2014 for example, The Big Guy goads an enemy into attacking them in order to protect The Chick or the Squishy Wizard. Tragically, he usually overestimates his own resilience. The trope can be Played for Laughs, but may end with Dude, Not Funny!. A game of Misery Poker may be involved, especially between siblings. A Family-Unfriendly Aesop usually results \u2014 \"if you can handle it, you should handle it, no matter how much it hurts you\". Occasionally, the mentor/parent will use the \"Because you can cope\" excuse as an excuse to cover up more sinister motives \u2014 or just their own thoughtlessness.
