Then the Doctor and Harry Kim find a solution with the transporter to reverse the effects, which should be a cause for celebration until Tuvix utters the Wham Line: \"I don't want to die.\" The episode then becomes a metaphorical trolley problem - let Tuvok and Neelix stay dead for the sake of this new being, or put Tuvix through the transporter to save two of their friends? Status Quo Is God on Voyager, and since you're on this particular page, you probably know where this is headed.\n\u2022 One episode of The Powerpuff Girls involves the titular characters creating an additional Powerpuff Girl... with ingredients that aren't exactly the same ones Prof. Utonium used, resulting in a horribly deformed Powerpuff Girl they called Bunny. Because of the Status Quo Is God rule, at the end of the episode, Bunny explodes into a big ball of light due to her growing unstable. At the end of the episode, the PPGs and the narrator himself mourn her. The narrator: For the first... and final time... The day is saved... thanks to the Powerpuff Bunny!
