{"title": "Overly Stereotypical Disguise", "content": "Gregory: When first I became one of the New Anarchists I tried all kinds of respectable disguises. I dressed up as a bishop. I read up all about bishops in our anarchist pamphlets, in Superstition the Vampire and Priests of Prey. I certainly understood from them that bishops are strange and terrible old men keeping a cruel secret from mankind. I was misinformed. When on my first appearing in episcopal gaiters in a drawing-room I cried out in a voice of thunder, \"Down! down! presumptuous human reason!\" they found out in some way that I was not a bishop at all. I was nabbed at once. Then I made up as a millionaire; but I defended Capital with so much intelligence that a fool could see that I was quite poor. Then I tried being a major. Now I am a humanitarian myself, but I have, I hope, enough intellectual breadth to understand the position of those who, like Nietzsche, admire violence \u2014 the proud, mad war of Nature and all that, you know. I threw myself into the major. I drew my sword and waved it constantly. I called out \"Blood!\" abstractedly, like a man calling for wine. I often said, \"Let the weak perish; it is the Law.\" Well, well, it seems majors don't do this. I was nabbed again.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverlyStereotypicalDisguise", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheManWhoWasThursday"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheWarOnStraw"]}
