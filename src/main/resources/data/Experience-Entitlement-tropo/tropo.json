{"title": "Experience Entitlement", "content": "Experience is an interesting concept. It is the knowledge or mastery of an event or subject gained through involvement in or exposure to. For that reason, more experience contributes to maturity and expertise. On its own, it's often a good, or even an expected thing, to be Taught by Experience.\n\nThis trope is about when \"experience matters\" is abused as an end-all, be-all. When Older Is Better is taken to its logical conclusion. In essence, \"I know/did/have/saw more than you did, therefore, I'm automatically better and you're inferior.\" The Arrogant Kung-Fu Guy may cite experience as a key factor to his or her superiority to someone of similar station. The Rich Bitch or Spoiled Brat will talk about their lavish trips and material possessions as reasons why they are above commoners. The Abusive Parent keeps their rowdy child in line by saying they know best because they know or saw more, lie or not. Or that Sore Loser you beat in a game says his defeat should be impossible because he's played longer.\n\nWhile experience does matter, there is a thing called a \"learning/experience curve.\" At some point, depending on the topic, two individuals will obtain the same amount of knowledge, and the rate at which they do can and will vary. Furthermore, sufficient research heralds an understanding of a matter that he or she may not (or cannot because Society Marches On) experience. It's even better if there are means to go back (i.e. the tapes kept circulating or there is a time machine) to get the authentic experience.\n\nIn other words, experience is merely one of the things that matter. At one point, you may have known more, but given time, that will no longer be true. At worst, no one will care and call you out for trying to paint yourself as inherently better. Keep espousing \"Experience Entitlement\" after that moment, and people may see you as pretentious or whiny.\n\nElitists tend to invoke this trope for better or worse. This can lead to such reactions like We Want Our Jerk Back, I Liked It Better When It Sucked, or It's Popular, Now It Sucks!.\n\nBoth the hardworking everyman and the Talented, but Trained will never use this trope as an excuse. They will often state they are \"still learning\". Also contrast the Logical Latecomer, who is new but can see through the nonsense the rest of the cast buys into.\n\nSee also Immortal Immaturity, Years Too Early. Compare Screw Politeness, I'm a Senior!.\n\nCan lead to Hard Work Hardly Works if the narrative winds up (unintentionally or otherwise) agreeing with this particular argument.\n\nIn-Universe Examples Only.
