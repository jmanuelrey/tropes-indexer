{"title": "Rotten Robotic Replacement", "content": "Unlike humans, robots aren't (usually) driven by emotional and irrational whims, don't need to take breaks, and can work efficiently based on their hardwired objectives and skills. So, it's no surprise that if a human is unable to do their job, a common solution is to replace them with a robotic version of themselves. Robots are more reliable, right?\n\nWrong. After being built to replace somebody, things start to go south. This is typically because the robot is a cold, emotionless machine who only cares about the end result and as a result does their job either without passion, without concern for anybody else, or with the willingness to dominate and destroy whoever gets in their way. In addition, robots, being machines, typically have a one-track mind and lack the ability to think creatively, making them unreasonable and too rule-oriented.\n\nThis may also be because robots, being machines, can malfunction and glitch. One more alternative is because the robot turns out to be just as irrational and flawed as the original human, but without the same memories, skills and personality, they can't do the job as well. Robots taking the place of people with authority, such as a parent or boss, are especially prone to becoming controlling and dominating, often contrasting the original person they replaced.\n\nSometimes it goes well at first, but through any number of reasons, the robot will go from helpful and competent to creating problems or outright harming people. Often, this is due to someone messing with it, like changing their settings or attempting to shut them down. In some cases the robot is so competent that someone decides to mess with it out of spite or insecurity.\n\nA subtrope of Ludd Was Right. Compare A.I.
