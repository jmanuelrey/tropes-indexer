I think you'll like this Sherman; Today we're going to witness the historic moment when chef George Crum shows the world his greatest creation: the potato chip!Lemme guess, instead of potato chips, he makes carrot chips. Or he doesn't believe in himself and we have to and do a bunch of time consuming montages to get his confidence back. It's never that simple.\n\nWhen history has changed, and the Main Characters must fix it, but there's no reason for it to have changed, that's a Wayback Trip. Unlike Set Right What Once Went Wrong, where the time travelers go back and defeat the villain, and as a result, history is changed for the better, in this trope, the time travelers go back and defeat the villain, and as a result history stays the same. The ultimate result is then either a Stable Time Loop (Rome always had secret lycanthropes all along) or a Close-Enough Timeline, perhaps in which the Main Characters Tricked Out Time (there were no monsters the \"first time around\", and the second time, there were but no one will be the wiser).\n\nThis trope seems to derive from the Adventure Towns treatment of Time Travel. Periods of history are treated like places rather than points on a timeline. New York in 1897 isn't the cause of New York in 2007, it's just 110 years earlier, and is free to have its own history and events.\n\nThis could technically be considered a case of Make Wrong What Once Went Right and Terminator Twosome, in that the Main Characters are changing history to make their (that is, our) timeline happen instead of the one with Roman vampire werewolf sorcerers.\n\nCan be handwaved by having a Delayed Ripple Effect.\n\nSee also Meanwhile, in the Future....
