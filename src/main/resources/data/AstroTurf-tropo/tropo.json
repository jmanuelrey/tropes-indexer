{"title": "AstroTurf", "content": "A false or simulated \"grass roots\" movement that's really a Viral Marketing campaign. AstroTurfing is not limited to blogs, but the recent prominence of the medium has made them a prime target for exploitation by groups with an agenda and a willingness to fake greater support than they really have. This might be a company, a political party, a religion, or any other kind of organization with more energy than integrity.\n\nThe word AstroTurf\u00ae is a brand name for artificial grass used for sports fields (so named because it was first used by the Houston Astros baseball team), thus it was \"hijacked\" to also mean an artificial \"grass roots\" movement. Note, however, that the trope is much older; it appears in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, and probably predates it by some time.\n\nAstroTurfing is usually managed by employing a large number of Sock Puppets to post messages supporting the group's position in various Fora, including blog comments and newsgroups, and by creating bogus blogs and websites that purport to be by \"real people\" but which are actually written by shills working for the group. Such people are called Meat Puppets to differentiate between the alternate identity of an interested person (Sock Puppet) and a third party induced to support them. Very often AstroTurfing extends out into the non-electronic world, with letters to newspapers from \"concerned citizens\", paid opinion pieces, and the formation of grass-roots lobbying groups that are actually funded by PR firms.\n\nAstroTurf efforts are often easily detectable, though, because such campaigns typically use a small number of templates for their messages and blogs, making them repetitive and eerily alike despite the geographic or social differences between alleged posters. (Sometimes the 'post this' instructions are thoughtlessly copy-pasted into the message as well.) It has been proposed that form letters should count as a single complaint in official statistics, regardless of the number of instances sent, to combat this.\n\nThe term has recently begun to gain wider usage in politics, and with it, a certain amount of subjectivity, resulting from of the varying interpretations of \"grassroots\" and what it means for an appearance of such to be \"fake\". For instance, a professionally-run organization may assist with the organization and publicity of a rally in support of an issue. On the one hand, those that attend the rally because of such efforts are likely sincere in their beliefs and, like most political involvement, go uncompensated. On the other hand, the rally and organization may attempt to present itself in such a way to downplay the professional involvement to appear more \"grassroots\" and thus, legitimate, when, at the same time, said involvement vastly contributed to its apparent success.\n\nThis latter point may cause opponents of the rally to claim there is an insincerity on a level that qualifies as \"astroturfing\", and whether you agree or not may depend on your personal views and definitions on any of a dozen levels. (The confusion, of course, stems from how many individuals will gladly advertise and work to further their political views without pay, in ways that they wouldn't for a corporate product. Even the most fanboyish veterans of Console Wars don't volunteer at phone-banks to promote their system of choice.)\n\nAnother occasional use of increased public attendance that might be viewed as astroturfing is at an event which is originally billed as some type of entertainment, and a Bait-and-Switch is pulled on the audience. These people are later described as grassroots supporters. In the 1970's one would sometimes find easily available tickets to free concerts, only to find that not only were they church group meetings or political rallies, but in news coverage, any PR people interviewed would show an obsessive need to repeatedly comment on the large attendance.\n\nAstro Turfing has been around for a long time, but became more popular as the Internet did, as it's easier to retain anonymity and still be widely read, and comments on news articles can be posted instantly (and repeatedly) with little to no moderation.\n\nFor the purposes of this page (and the Rule of Cautious Editing Judgment), we shall place emphasis on specific incidents with confirmed little-to-no unpaid involvement.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Astroturf",
