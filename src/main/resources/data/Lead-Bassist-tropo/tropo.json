{"title": "Lead Bassist", "content": "The Ace of Spades doesn't need to play lead guitar to be awesome.\n\nSo Nobody Loves the Bassist, eh? Think again. That dude in the spotlight, the one everyone's cheering for, the famous face everybody remembers ... is it me, or is that axe he/she's wielding suspiciously oversized? VINDICATION! The Lead Bassist takes up an instrument that screams \"anonymous role-player,\" and somehow rides it to fame. For one reason or another, he's better-known than the band's lead guitarist, or even the lead singer.\n\nBut what could cause such a perversion of the natural order? There are four fundamental factors that can give birth to a Lead Bassist:\n\nType A: The Virtuoso. This bassist is so famously skilled and so near the top of the field as to overshadow the band's other musicians\u2014who may be excellent in their own right, but not necessarily at the pinnacle.\n\nType B: The Singer. This musician is mainly famous for being a lead vocalist, or part of a Vocal Tag Team. The fact that he plays a bass is secondary, and may even go unnoticed by casual fans.\n\nType C: The Face of the Band. This bass player is well known for non-musical reasons, such as:\n\u2022 Being a founder or guiding creative spirit of the band.\n\u2022 Engaging in notorious behavior, such as drunken misadventures or a newsworthy love life.\n\u2022 Having a successful career in acting or another field outside of music.\n\u2022 Having a successful career when leaving the band.\n\u2022 Dying tragically ... or at least memorably.\n\nType D: The Genre Lead. Rather than rock or popular music, this bassist plays jazz, funk, African folk music, etc., genres in which the bass cuts a larger figure\u2014sometimes even a central one.\n\nBassists may qualify under more than one of these tropes: Paul McCartney, for example, manages to flawlessly embody Types A, B, and C.\n\nThis is not a list of \"Good Bassists\" or \"Bassists I Like.\" This page is for bass players who, for one reason or another, garner a distinctly larger share of public notice than more traditional band \"frontmen\" such as the singer or lead guitarist. If the bassist is the least-known member of the band, he doesn't belong here, however well-regarded he is (future musicologists will dub this the \"Entwistle-J.P. Jones barrier\").\n\nContrast Nobody Loves the Bassist. Sister Trope of Lead Drummer. Does not refer to a bassist made out of lead.\n\u2022 Before switching primarily to the guitar, Abbath Doom Occulta was the bassist/singer/frontman for Immortal.\n\u2022 Martin Eric Ain was a co-Face of the Band and spokesman during his tenure with Celtic Frost.\n\u2022 Juan Alderete de la Pe\u00f1a of Vato Negro is the lead instrumentalist for his band's unique style of bass-driven noise rock, and has a sizable internet following because of his online effects-pedal reviews.\n\u2022 Emma Anzai of Sick Puppies is just as well known as lead singer/guitarist Shim Moore. Due to their nature as a 3 piece band, Anzai's bass has a lot of room to shine,and each album sees her stepping up to the mic more and more often from simple backing vocals, to vocal tag team and outright taking the lead here and there. She's also considered very attractive.\n\u2022 Cliff Burton (Type A), late bassist of Metallica for their first 3 albums before his death in a freak bus crash in 1986. Also a Type C, being a primary songwriter for the band, as well as being famous for the freak accident that killed him.\n\u2022 Tom Araya is lead vocalist and frontman of Slayer.\n\u2022 During her stint with Kittie, Talena Atfield was the band's undisputed Ms. Fanservice.\n\u2022 Not only is Walter Becker a famously virtuosic bass player, but after the first few albums, he and Donald Fagen pretty much were Steely Dan. Co-face and co-songwriter of the band with Fagen.\n\u2022 Jean Baudin of Nuclear Rabbit: Types A (rocks an 11-string bass!), C (he's the founder/leader), and D (the music's built around his eccentric technique).\n\u2022 Sean Beasley of Dying Fetus constitutes half of a Vocal Tag Team with John Gallagher.\n\u2022 Jason Netherton is now the frontman for Misery Index and was once the frontman of Dying Fetus.\n\u2022 Brett Beavers was the bassist and bandleader for Martina McBride and Lee Ann Womack, and has since become a songwriter and producer.\n\u2022 Adam Biggs of Rivers of Nihil: Type A (he's got a huge amount of technical ability, though the years have made him less hell-bent on showcasing it at every opportunity), B (he serves as the second vocalist, contrasting Jake Dieffenbach's mid-ranged bellow with higher rasps and the occasional guttural lows), C (he writes the vast majority of the lyrics and shares primary songwriting duties with Brody Uttley), and D (his basslines factor heavily into their established style and seldom do exactly what the guitar does, often playing lead lines or creating a melodic backdrop instead of necessarily playing rhythm all the time).\n\u2022 Jack Blades has been the co-lead singer for both Night Ranger and the supergroup Damn Yankees.\n\u2022 Andreas Blomqvist of Seventh Wonder is his band's big name, famous both as a founder and for his fret-tapping speed runs.\n\u2022 Derek Boyer of Suffocation is notorious for his bizarro antics, both onstage and off, while his enormous bass sound, distinctive tone, and considerable technical prowess factor heavily into Suffocation's current sound and live reputation.\n\u2022 Ron Broder is the bassist and lead singer of Coroner.\n\u2022 Brian Bromberg: Behold an example of his work . All those \"guitar\" tracks are actually bass lines (with the strings tuned up high). He's released several \"bass-only\" albums. Don't love the bassist? Too-bad\u2014he's all you've got!\n\u2022 Jack Bruce was the bassist and primary singer of Cream, and had a low key but well-regarded solo career.\n\u2022 Michael \"Fat Mike\" Burkett is the singer and bandleader of NOFX.\n\u2022 John Cale (Velvet Underground, solo), Types B and C, through his songwriting, production, and multi-instrumental skills.\n\u2022 Ken Casey of the Dropkick Murphys is the co-lead singer, songwriter, and sole remaining founding member.\n\u2022 Erlend Caspersen (Blood Red Throne, Spawn of Possession, Deeds of Flesh, etc.): Type A, also a Type C due to his highly influential status among metal bassists.\n\u2022 Peter Cetera was the co-lead vocalist of Chicago, and enjoyed a successful solo career afterwards.\n\u2022 Al Cisneros (Sleep, Shrinebuilder): Type B, C and D. With Sleep, Cisneros was such a key figures in the evolution of Doom Metal that he can be partly credited with the importance of the bass in the genre.\n\u2022 Stanley Clarke (Return to Forever, The Seatbelts) is a genuine jazz celebrity, as well as a bandleader in his own right.\n\u2022 Primus's Les Claypool is the epitome of Lead Bassist: A) He's one of the greatest bass players of all time, B) He's Primus's lead singer, C) He's face of the band, and D) Primus's sound is centered around his bass playing, which means he hits all four criteria.\n\u2022 Bootsy Collins (George Clinton) is one of funk's most recognizable faces and sounds, and even sang occasionally (with Bootsy's Rubber Band).\n\u2022 Max Collins is the singer and frontman of Eve 6.\n\u2022 John Crawford was the primary songwriter for Berlin.\n\u2022 John Cooper is known as the vocalist of Skillet.\n\u2022 John Cowan was the lead vocalist of the bluegrass band New Grass Revival.\n\u2022 Kim Deal was the face of The Pixies alongside Black Francis, sang the occasional lead, and was the lead singer and bandleader of The Breeders.\n\u2022 Russell DeCarle is the lead singer of Country Music band Prairie Oyster.\n\u2022 Joey DeMaio of Manowar is the band's main songwriter, and famous for his piccolo bass and solos.\n\u2022 Jay DeMarcus of Rascal Flatts is somewhat well-known outside the band for several Record Producer and co-writer credits.\n\u2022 Carlos Dengler, formerly of Interpol, was as recognized in the band as the lead singer.\n\u2022 James Dewar sang for both the Robin Trower Band and Stone the Crows.\n\u2022 Steve DiGiorgio (Death, Autopsy, Control Denied, Dark Haul, Faust, Testament, Vintersorg, Iced Earth, Sebastian Bach, Charred Walls of the Damned, Obituary, Sadus, Dragonlord, the list could go on): Type A for his technical skills on the fretless bass and a Type C for being in all of those bands and many more (for at least one album).\n\u2022 John Doe of the punk band X is the band's founder, bassist, co-songwriter, and the male half of its Vocal Tag Team. He's also had notable TV and movie roles, including a recurring stint on Roswell.\n\u2022 Leif Edling of Candlemass is celebrated as the band's main songwriter.\n\u2022 Bernard Edwards was a central identifying face of Chic, a defining contributor to the band's signature funk sound, and a well-known songwriter/producer. He was also co-lead vocalist, though this was less well-known to the general public as his lead vocals tended to remain as album tracks.\n\u2022 Flea (Michael Balzary) of Red Hot Chili Peppers is considered a leading pioneer of his craft. He's also arguably the most famous member of the band, with his memorable nickname, distinctive appearance and acting roles doing him great service. He's also technically the only continuous member of the band, since vocalist Anthony Kiedis was fired for at least a month during the 80s.\n\u2022 Mike Flores of (Origin) usually steals the spotlight because of his fast and highly technical playing\u2014not to mention that he's one of the band's main songwriters, an occasional stand-in vocalist, and has the second-longest uninterrupted tenure after Paul Ryan.\n\u2022 Sharin Foo of The Raveonettes is half of a Vocal Tag Team (alongside Sune Rose Wagner).\n\u2022 Dave Fridmann of Mercury Rev is a household name in the industry\u2014not only for his band, but as a producer both for them and the Flaming Lips.\n\u2022 Teddy Gentry of Alabama. Although the band has only ever released singles with Randy Owen on lead vocals (except \"Mountain Music\", where Gentry and guitarist Jeff Cook each sing one line drummer Mark Herndon never sang, and left the group in the 2000s ), both Gentry and Cook have sung lead on several album cuts. In addition, Gentry wrote hit singles for Shenandoah and George Strait, and has produced for Emerson Drive.\n\u2022 The Brazilian bassist/vocalist Humberto Gessinger has become the only steady member of Engenheiros do Hawaii.\n\u2022 There's a funny example of this trope also in Brazil: a forr\u00f3 band became viral on YouTube simply because of the narmtastic dance of the bass player Junior Groovador during the recording of the song . While there's another known videos of him throughout the Internet, the rest of the band didn't have the same popularity.\n\u2022 Rodrigo Gonz\u00e1lez is the co-vocalist of the German punk rock band Die \u00c4rzte.\n\u2022 Kim Gordon, Sonic Youth's co-singer and co-Face of the Band.\n\u2022 Larry Graham is the inventor of the \"slapping\" technique, which he popularized with both Sly and the Family Stone and Graham Central Station.\n\u2022 Keith Grimwood of Trout Fishing In America is a Type B, since he splits lead vocals about 50-50 with guitarist Ezra Idlet and they write most of their songs together.\n\u2022 Steve Grisaffe has been the lead singer and bassist of the country band River Road since 1997.\n\u2022 Steve Harris of Iron Maiden is a seminal figure among bass players, writes most of the band's songs and is as recognized as Bruce Dickinson.

Thanks to his swoonworthy mug and relative proficiency in English, he's become co-Face of the Band (along with singer Kenta Koie) in Western-media appearances.\n\u2022 Japan bassist Mick Karn was known for his melodic fretless playing.\n\u2022 Ricardo Iorio, bassist and singer of the Argentinian bands V8, Herm\u00e9tica, and Almafuerte, is considered a seminal figure in his country's metal and popular-music scenes ... bordering on national-hero status.\n\u2022 James Jamerson (Funk Brothers/Motown Records session musician) is both a famous virtuoso and a purveyor of essentially bass-driven funk genres.\n\u2022 Gary Jarman of the Cribs is half of a Vocal Tag Team type with his twin Brother, Ryan.\n\u2022 Janice Marie Johnson was both the lead vocalist and lead bassist of A Taste of Honey.\n\u2022 Percy Jones (Brand X, Tunnels, various Brian Eno albums): Type A, without a doubt, and on fretless electric bass, to boot.\n\u2022 Jesse F.

Lane was also a frequent songwriter for both groups.\n\u2022 Dominic \"Forest\" LaPointe (Augury, Beyond Creation, Atheretic, Quo Vadis etc.): Type A. Mastering a left-handed 6-string fretless bass guitar is bound to get quite some attention.\n\u2022 Sonny LeMaire, bassist of Exile, sang lead vocals on several occasions after lead vocalist J. P.

Canonical combo of A and B.\n\u2022 White Wizzard's Jon Leon earns his Type C by being the founder and only permanent member of a Revolving Door Band.\n\u2022 Symphony X's Mike Le Pond has more than earned his Type A status with his incredible technical skill and flashy, virtuosic playstyle that nonetheless can take a backseat to playing for the song when need be. His myriad other projects certainly help, and he was also known for being a Cliff Burton-like figure in his early days, where he played in various bar bands; plenty of people who knew him from that time knew him as the incredibly talented bassist playing in perpetual local openers.\n\u2022 Phil Lesh of the Grateful Dead was not only the member of the Grateful Dead to put on the most successful solo shows after the Grateful Dead disbanded, but he even took over some leadership responsibilities of the band after Jerry Garcia passed away. Though not a major song writer of the band, he did influence the sound and assist in some of the band's hits in writing. Lesh is also known in many ways as one of the first Bass players to break away from the traditional timekeeping role within the beat of the song being played, further influencing the classic sound of the Grateful Dead.\n\u2022 John Lodge of The Moody Blues is part of a Vocal Tag Team (and co-songwriter) with Justin Hayward.\n\u2022 Bruce Loose and the late Will Shatter of Flipper were co-vocalists and co-bassists, depending on the song.\n\u2022 Garry Lowe is Big Sugar's most ear-catching and eye-catching member: amidst a nattily dressed hard-rock/blues band with country influences stands a shirtless, wild-haired Jamaican churning out funk jams and R&B riffs.\n\u2022 Nick Lowe can play several instruments, but has often functioned as the bassist in bands which he has played in or lead \u2014 and has sometimes been the facke or joint face of those bands. That puts him in type B, but his skills as a songwriter and producer probably move him more into type C.\n\u2022 Marcus Luscombe is the lead singer of Cormorant.\n\u2022 During his time with Thin Lizzy, Phil Lynott was the principal songwriter, singer, and Face of the Band.\n\u2022 Singer-songwriter Aimee Mann was the bassist, singer, and Face of the Band for Til Tuesday, and still frequently plays the bass in her solo output.\n\u2022 Michael Manring's latter-day output consists of solo fretless-bass performances, leading one admirer to quip \"he's not so much a bass player as he is a one-man band who just happens to play bass.\"\n\u2022 Ryan Martinie of Mudvayne is the band's musical focus of attention, renowned for his unique, percussive style that owes not a little to flamenco.\n\u2022 Terry McBride was the bassist and lead singer of the country band McBride & the Ride in The '90s, and later became noted for his songwriting (including for Brooks & Dunn, who later had him play bass in their road band).\n\u2022 Paul McCartney: A, B, and C. Probably the best known bassist of all, helped by turning the violin-looking Hofner bass into an Iconic Item.\n\u2022 Tatsu Mikami is a Type C. He even acknowledged it when everyone else in Church of Misery left by saying that the band wasn't going anywhere and that he had already written another entire album and just needed to find a new lineup.\n\u2022 Mike Mills sang several R.E.M. songs, and in public often served as co-Face of the Band (with Michael Stipe).\n\u2022 Charles Mingus, Jazz double bassist , composer and bandleader.

Post-Metallica, he became the vocalist/songwriter of his own self-named group.\n\u2022 Tomomi Ogawa was co-vocalist, main lyricist, and well-liked mascot of SCANDAL (not the Patty Smyth band, the Japanese one).\n\u2022 Richard Page was the lead singer (and male-model face) of the '80s band Mr. Mister.\n\u2022 For better or worse, Nick Oliveri has made his mark in several bands:\n\u2022 He's often credited with co-creating \"stoner metal\" as a member of Kyuss.\n\u2022 With Queens of the Stone Age, he famously wore out his welcome with epic drug abuse, capped off by spousal abuse.\n\u2022 After his QOTSA tenure, Oliveri founded and sang lead for the band Mondo Generator.\n\u2022 Benjamin Orr of The Cars was the co-lead singer, and The Face Of The Band along with Ric Ocasek.\n\u2022 The virtuosic bass skills of Atheist's Roger Patterson were responsible for a good bit of the band's early buzz).

Unfortunately, he became nearly as famous for his sudden alcoholic descent and unfortunate death.\n\u2022 Aaron Pauley of Of Mice & Men became a Type B in 2017.\n\u2022 Tom Petersson: Type C\u2014he's not more memorable than Rick Nielsen or Bun E. Carlos, but he certainly rings more of a bell than singer Robin Zander.\n\u2022 Dickie Peterson was the lead singer for (Blue Cheer, those proto-metal pioneers of the psychedelic era.\n\u2022 Doug Phelps of The Kentucky Headhunters became a Type B the hard way. He originally sang backing vocals and played bass, while his brother Ricky Lee Phelps sang lead. Both of them quit after the second album, with a new lead singer and bassist (Mark S.

He was equally, and sadly, famous for his substance abuse, recurring mental problems, and suspicious death.\n\u2022 Nick Schendzielos of Cephalic Carnage, Job for a Cowboy, and Havok hits all four on the head, being a Type A (renowned for his incredible technical skill and creative playing), Type B (he does secondary vocals in Cephalic Carnage and backing live vocals in Havok), Type C (his face is well-known in the bass world between his YouTube channel and frequent NAMM appearances, plus he's become a secondary Face of the Band for both Job for a Cowboy and Havok due in no small part to his oddball sense of humor and amusing interviews), and Type D (his basslines became a very major and integral part of Job for a Cowboy's sound circa Sun Eater).\n\u2022 Marcel \"Schmier\" Schirmer is the vocalist for Destruction.\n\u2022 Jacob Schmidt of Defeated Sanity is a firm Type A and Type C, as he shares songwriting duties with Lille Gruber and is renowned for both his astounding technical ability and deep knowledge of theory.\n\u2022 Singer Tommy Scott of Space was the group's bassist in its early years, and on its first album.\n\u2022 Jason Sellers: Type B and C.

With jazz group Niacin, he's arguably a type D as well.\n\u2022 Burke Shelly of Budgie, under Type B (the singer), and Type C (he co-wrote the band's songs and has been the only consistent member of the group).\n\u2022 Gene Simmons is a huge combination of Types B and C, writing most songs with Paul Stanley (the other Face of the Band), singing at least half the tracks, and being the most recognizable of the band members without makeup (he loves to give interviews, has written several books, and has had his own reality show).\n\u2022 Actor Gary Sinise is also a bassist, and founder of the Lt. Dan Band. Once, he got to pluck his bass on CSI: NY, and four-stringers everywhere rejoiced.\n\u2022 Nikki Sixx wrote most M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce songs with [[Lead Drummer/Tommy Lee]]. His notoriously wild life (including being dead for a few minutes!) was even better known.\n\u2022 Zach Smith of Pinback has a very distinct playing style (heavy on chords, tapping, and melody lines on a short-scale bass) and plays Vocal Tag Team alongside guitarist Rob Crow.\n\u2022 Steve Soto was the one constant of the Revolving Door Band the Adolescents.\n\u2022 Greg Spawton, the co-founder and main songwriter of Big Big Train, willingly assumed this mantle by switching from guitar to bass.\n\u2022 Squarepusher: Types A and C\u2014his bass playing is as well-known as his electronic work.\n\u2022 Yes's bassist Chris Squire was the prototypical Type A.

Wrote all the songs, was the public face of the band, and a sex symbol to female fans (and some male ones) after his Playgirl magazine shoot.\n\u2022 John Taylor: Type C, especially as he's Heterosexual Life-Partners with the only consistent member of the band, Nick Rhodes. Also a mild case of A, since John's unorthodox and genre-defying basslines were uncommon at the time, but widely emulated since then.\n\u2022 Kavyen Temperley of Eskimo Joe: Type B and C.\n\u2022 Jeroen Paul Thesseling: Type A. Playing with two acclaimed Technical Death Metal (Pestilence and Obscura) bands is bound to get you some respect.

Verni is a Type A and Type C, as he's the only founding member remaining other than Bobby, in addition to his basslines playing a very prominent role in the band's sound.\n\u2022 Sid Vicious: Type C, with a giant, 72-point \"C\" (and he couldn't even play!)\n\u2022 Roger Waters: The lead creative force and co-lead singer of Pink Floyd between Syd Barrett's departure and the band's 1980s resurrection.

(He's also known for being the band's main lyricist.)\n\u2022 John Wetton was the lead singer and resident bass virtuoso of late '70s King Crimson, U.K., and Asia.\n\u2022 Tina Weymouth of the Talking Heads also sang lead with the Tom Tom Club.\n\u2022 Verdine White of Earth, Wind & Fire is in category A, C and D. Not only is he a top-notch funk bassist, he's the only one (with bandleader/founder Maurice White's passing in 2016) to be with the band from Day One. During the Seventies, one of the highlights of the band's concerts was his bass solo where he would be playing suspended in mid-air.\n\u2022 The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson is the band's best-known member, renowned for his singing voice, as the genius behind the group's most seminal albums (even though he played less and less bass by that time), and for his later struggles with substance abuse and mental issues.\n\u2022 Doug Wimbish of Living Colour. On top of his own solo work, he's also done work for Tackhead, Jungle Funk, The Rolling Stones, and many others.\n\u2022 Kip Winger was his band's lead singer and lancer (The Hero, of course, was Winger's hair).\n\u2022 Nicky Wire of Manic Street Preachers is a Type C. He has been the most well known member of the band since Edwards disappeared, thanks to being the primary lyric writer and his flamboyant stage presence.\n\u2022 Jah Wobble was Type A in Public Image Ltd. and added Type C in his other ventures.\n\u2022 Victor Wooten: Type A. Arguably Type D, but that would require his conforming to a genre.\n\u2022 Rob Wright is the lead singer of Nomeansno. He's also a founding member, and a virtuoso bassist who gives the band's punk recordings a startlingly progressive undergirding.\n\u2022 Doris Yeh: Type C to a T. Also Type B for her role of supporting vocals as well.\n\u2022 Da Yoopers have gone through several bassists (Jim Pennell, Joe DeLongchamp, Doc Bradbury, Jim Bellmore, Reggie Lusardi). Each of them has gotten at least one turn on lead vocal. DeLongchamp and guitarist/bassist Bellmore also handled songwriting duties.\n\u2022 Miracles of Modern Science's bassist Evan Younger is also the lead singer.\n\u2022 Dan Andriano of Alkaline Trio. While singer/guitarist Matt Skiba is more well known (especially now he's in that other band), bassist Dan is co-lead singer and songwriter; a Type B all over.\n\u2022 Dallon Weekes is the founder, singer, songwriter, and face of I Don't Know How But They Found Me, although it should be noted that the band only has one other member, drummer Ryan Seaman. Dallon was also the Lead Bassist of his old band, The Brobecks, though he shared singing and writing credits with other members.\n\u2022 P\u00e4r Sundstr\u00f6m of Sabaton is the secondary Face of the Band alongside lead vocalist Joakim Brod\u00e9n. In addition to co-writing the songs with Joakim and having about as much interview time, P\u00e4r has regularly sung backing vocals since the 2012 lineup change (he and Joakim are the only founding members remaining).\n\u2022 Mio Akiyama is a type B and (less-than-willing) C.\n\u2022 Ditto with Yuu Haruna, who is initially a Type B (being the co-vocalist of his band) but more or less has elements of Type C as well.\n\u2022 Cassandra is both the B and C of her band Crucial Taunt, to the point that her manager's plan in the sequel is to distance her from the rest of the band.\n\u2022 Guitar Hero: World Tour: Shirley Crowley becomes a Face of the Band example, having a impressive solo career.\n\u2022 Murdoc Niccals: Type C\u2014he co-founded the band, and makes most of their headlines in his semi-cartoon universe by virtue of being an Axe-Crazy Psychopathic Manchild.\n\u2022 Yamato/Matt Ishida in Digimon Adventure 02 and Digimon Adventure tri. is the bassist and vocalist of his bands. He has several fangirls, notably Jun Motomiya.\n\u2022 Charlie Pace (Drive Shaft 4 ever!) is Type C.\n\u2022 Scott Pilgrim is not only the hero of his eponymous comic series and movie, he's the sole original member of his band.\n\u2022 The 2nd Gym Leader in Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2, Roxie is the leader of her band. Both Type B as the band's singer and Type C as a Gym Leader.\n\u2022 Naturally, it also carries over to her anime appearance. You know the two other trainers you face in the Virbank Gym in the game? They're her bandmates in the anime.\n\u2022 Spinal Tap: On \"Big Bottom,\" David, Nigel, and Derek treat the listener to a triple-bass assault! (Harry Shearer rocks a double-neck.)\n\u2022 Adventure Time: Marceline and the Scream Queens reveals Marceline to be a Type B, so much that her bandmates have never been seen on the show.\n\u2022 Somewhat subverted for Murderface in Metalocalypse, since the band claims they mix out his parts in post, but during concerts he displays a talent for playing the bass with his penis.\n\u2022 In Iron Zion, Jan Doornenbal is Type A (and gets into musical duels with his band members) and B, whenever a song has Dutch or Frisian lyrics (he sings along with his brother) and somewhat Type C, since a double bass is unusual in Heavy Metal, and also having a classical side project with his brother.\n\u2022 The nameless singer in Guitar Hero On Tour is a type B.\n\u2022 Sgt. Floyd Pepper of the Electric Mayhem in The Muppets is a type C. Although Dr. Teeth leads the band, Floyd is easily the most recognizable member after Animal, overshadowing Dr. Teeth, and the one who talks the most to Kermit. He also often sings lead vocals whenever the band is shown performing.\n\u2022 Mae Borowski of Night in the Woods is a type C by virtue of being the Player Character who just happens to play bass; the four friends never perform in public, leaving their actual memorability up in the air. Then again, depending on how well you play during each practice, she potentially demonstrates an amazing talent at improvising songs that she has never performed before.\n\u2022 AW Yrj\u00e4n\u00e4 of the Finnish band CMX is both type C, being a founding member of the band, and type B, being the singer. He is arguably type A thanks to his lyrical prowess (though the band's lyrics are only in Finnish).\n\u2022 Murdoc Niccals of Gorillaz is a Type C for invoking the birth and demise of the band and a Magnificent Bastard In-Universe, as well as having a large fanbase out of universe for both being Creepy Awesome as well as his bass playing in songs like \"Feel Good Inc.\"\n\u2022 Andy McCluskey of Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark is Type B as the band's frontman.\n\u2022 Davide Biale of Davie504 is this to a tee - all of his videos are about him slapping the bass.", "url":
