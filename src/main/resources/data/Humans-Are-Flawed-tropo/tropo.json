{"title": "Humans Are Flawed", "content": "Christopher's thoughts: The man was most certainly not the nicest of his kind. If it wasn't because Christopher knew better, he would give him away to the MNU right away. But the prawn had seen, on his first weeks on this planet, the softer, more generous side of this race. Had they not given them food and shelter instead of killing them all? Had they not provided a home once they knew they would never be able to leave, granted that home was not as cozy or as welcoming as one could hope? Maybe this human could still prove his worth. And gazing at the human's new arm he got the feeling the human would at least give it a try, since now he had no choice but to adapt, like he himself, along with all his people, had had to learn to adapt once on a strange new world. Christopher understood the man, because he knew well what it was like to be trapped in a world in which you don't seem to belong.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed?from=Main.HumanityIsFlawed", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/District9"], "non_media_links": ["https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5642845/1/Deleted_scene", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotHero"]}
