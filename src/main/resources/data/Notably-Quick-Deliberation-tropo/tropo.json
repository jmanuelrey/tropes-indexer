{"title": "Notably Quick Deliberation", "content": "Are we even sure there's a room behind that door?\n\nThe closing arguments are over, and the defense attorney retires to a meeting room to discuss the case and possible outcomes with his or her client.\n\nOnly after a short amount of dramatic dialogue, a court aide or other supporting character comes back and tells the defense that deliberation has concluded and the verdict is to be read.\n\nCausing people in and out of universe to exclaim \"Already?\"\n\nSince jury trials include a great deal of information (opening arguments, the testimony of multiple witnesses, cross examinations, and so on), jury deliberations, which should review all this material as well as instructions from the judge, are expected to take considerable time. When a jury returns a verdict in half an hour or less, this trope is in effect.\n\nThere are several possible reasons for the rapid deliberation:\n\u2022 One side may have had a really weak case. If a Frivolous Lawsuit makes it as far as a jury trial, hopefully this will kick in.\n\u2022 The trial's been dragging on for a while, and the jurors have already had plenty of time to think about the evidence.\n\u2022 The jurors are biased, and letting their biases do the voting. This isn't supposed to happen (juror selection is meant to find an unbiased jury), but it does.\n\u2022 The case is being heard before a single judge (a bench trial) instead of a jury.\n\nIn news coverage, reporters tend to assume this trope is operating. It's common for news reports to say \"just\" or \"only\" when noting how long deliberations took, as if they expected them to be out longer.\n\nCan happen as part of a Kangaroo Court. Often practiced by a Joker Jury. May also figure in a Miscarriage of Justice. A trial for a Frivolous Lawsuit should be this assuming the jury isn't stupid or rigged. A Rogue Juror can subvert this trope.\n\nWhile this can be Truth in Television, please think twice before posting Real Life examples.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotablyQuickDeliberation", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/PlutosJudgementDay", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGeorgeLopezShow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SheHulk", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TwelveAngryMen", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BackToTheFuturePartII", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ToKillAMockingbird", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Radio/OurMissBrooks", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DorothyLSayers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LordPeterWimsey", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGeorgeLopezShow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFlash2014", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Batman1966", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TokusouSentaiDekaranger", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/PinkFloyd", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RootyTootToot", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SuperFriends", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ClassicDisneyShorts", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/PlutosJudgementDay", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AlFranken", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FoxNewsChannel", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FattyArbuckle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JFK"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KangarooCourt", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JokerJury", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiscarriageOfJustice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrivolousLawsuit", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogueJuror", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBWImNSV0Z0", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenWire", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogueJuror", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RogueJuror", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HopeSpot", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HollywoodLaw", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationTrinket", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearInsideHourOutside", "http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/11/justice/florida-stand-ground-sentencing"]}
