{"title": "Took a Level in Cynic", "content": "he can bring Crow back to Thors Military Academy after he revealed himself to be the leader of the Imperial Liberation Front and sided with the Noble Alliance at the end of the first game. Crow dies after teaming up with Rean to fight the Vermillion Apocalypse. Immediately after Crow passes away, the man who Crow attempted to assassinate to avenge his grandfather, Chancellor Osborne, is actually not dead despite being shot in the chest. Rean then learns that Chancellor Osborne is his real father. Rean then goes off to help Erebonia complete its invasion of Crossbell using his Ashen Knight. When he returns to Thors after Osborne annexes Crossbell, Rean has lost his optimism. Promo art for Cold Steel III shows Rean with a not quite dead look in his eyes like Joshua had in Trails in the Sky, but he is certainly a changed man.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInCynic?from=Main.TookALevelInCynicism", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfHeroesTrailsOfColdSteel"], "non_media_links": []}
