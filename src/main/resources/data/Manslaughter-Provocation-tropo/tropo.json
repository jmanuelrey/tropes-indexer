{"title": "Manslaughter Provocation", "content": "Bob has made his wife Alice's life a living hell. He beats her, he closely monitors her movements and he effectively prevents her from living a normal life.\n\nAs he's about to beat her for the three-hundredth time, Alice suddenly grabs the ashtray and strikes him across the head. Bob dies on the way to the hospital and Alice is arrested for his murder. There is no doubt that she's done it, but wouldn't anyone else do what she did if faced with what she's gone through?\n\nAlice's lawyers decide that Alice denies murder, but will claim manslaughter by provocation. The question is now, will the jury agree?\n\n\"Manslaughter by provocation\", in English law, requires actual provocation and must pass a test of whether a reasonable, sober, self-controlled person would do it. The other partial defenses are diminished responsibility and suicide pacts.\n\nIn the US, it is one of the three partial defenses to murder (the others being diminished and unjustified use of force in what they thought was self-defense).\n\nIn both cases, the crime becomes voluntary manslaughter rather than murder, which could still carry prison time, but it's far less than actual murder charges.\n\nIt used to be the case that catching your spouse in the act of adultery was considered sufficient provocation for murder (though the ancient Celts had a time limit on that, you were expected to have cooled down three days after the adultery). Generally, most people nowadays agree that you're not allowed to kill someone for that.\n\nThis can be Truth in Television, sadly enough.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManslaughterProvocation", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheCryingGame", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BillyBudd", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMentalState", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TheBBC", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderUK", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BadGirls", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/WaterlooRoad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Justified", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HellOnWheels", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/KennyRogers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Chicago", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SilentHill2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Danganronpa", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/DanganronpaTriggerHappyHavoc", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/SuperDanganRonpa2"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DomesticAbuse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathByWomanScorned", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ControlFreak", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InformedAttribute", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CountryMusic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalIncest", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AndZoidberg", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution"]}
