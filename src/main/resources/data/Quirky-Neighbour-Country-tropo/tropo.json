{"title": "Quirky Neighbour Country", "content": "Many countries, big and small, have a Quirky Neighbour Country.\n\nIt's that country on your border, usually smaller and/or less populous than your own country. They speak the same language as you (albeit in a funny accent), or something that sounds very much like it. They also share a lot of their history and culture with your country; in fact, their country is just like yours, except it's... quirky. You and your countrymen make jokes about them very often; their bizarre laws and practices never cease to amaze you. The citizens of the Quirky Neighbour Country will often take these jokes in good spirit and occasionally crack a few jokes back at your country, which they might view as a Quirky Neighbour Country.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyNeighbourCountry", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackBooks", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheITCrowd", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FlightOfTheConchords", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GavinAndStacey", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ScandinaviaAndTheWorld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenjaminFranklin"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CanadaEh", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MexicanAmericans", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSixties", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalkanizeMe", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongList", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/WorldWarII", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeparatedByACommonLanguage", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewEngland", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeepSouth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigApplesauce", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Joisey", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheOtherRainforest", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hipster", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Suburbia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Gangsterland", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Suburbia"]}
