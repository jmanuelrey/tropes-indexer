The song's producer? None other than Jimi Hendrix.\n\u2022 is a medley by The 5th Dimension.\n\u2022 Listen to a classic rock station long enough, and you will likely hear \"Devil In A Blue Dress/Good Golly Miss Molly\" by Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels. Depending on the station, you might even hear the version that includes \"CC Rider\".\n\u2022 In Homestuck a few important songs are medleys of other songs:\n\u2022 Descend , the song that plays at the end of Act 4, is a medley of many, many other songs. How many? Here's the list . (The last song on the list - marked with a ??? - is from a currently unreleased song known as Penumbra Phantasm. However, that music would also be used in Umbral Ultimatium, which starts with the ending of Descend.)\n\u2022 Cascade , the song that plays at the end of Act 5, is composed of four separate songs: Cascade (Beta) (originally another composer's take on Descend ), Flare , Savior of the Dreaming Dead , and Black Hole / Green Sun (a remix of Black Rose / Green Sun ).\n\u2022 Rex Duodecim Angelus , a song from the official albums, contains the Leitmotifs of most of the trolls.\n\u2022 The Australian Voices do a medley taken Up to Eleven: a classical style piece that's actually made up of fragments of 35 different pop songs.

In perticular was the medley on Three Sides Live, which would begin with \"In The Cage\", incorporate the synth solo from \"The Colony Of Slippermen\", move into the instrumental section of \"The Cinema Show\", then end with \"...In That Quiet Earth\" and \"Afterglow\" Often sections from \"Firth Of Fifth\" and Supper's Ready would be included, too.\n\u2022 A so-called \"Blues Brothers\" medley, incorporating \"Turn It On Again\" with medleys of soul and pop classics from The '60s with the band wearing Cool Shades and fedoras, ended their shows in the mid-to-late '80's.\n\u2022 The boss theme for Lord Passion in MOTHER 3 is a medley of the first movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5, Bach's Toccata in D Minor, the \"Hallelujah\" chorus from Handel's Messiah oratorio, and the first movement of the \"Spring\" violin concerto by Vivaldi.\n\u2022 The music for the final stage of the arcade Battletoads rearranges the first stage's theme (which is also the boss theme) with bits of the second, third, and fourth stages' themes weaved in.\n\u2022 Amy Grant has one called \"Ageless Medley\" which covers many of her own songs.\n\u2022 Straight No Chaser has a medley in every single one of their Christmas albums.\n\u2022 The Super Smash Bros. series loves its medleys.
