{"title": "God for a Day", "content": "A character can be tested and taught to learn their weaknesses and strengths not just by making them suffer burden and limitation but by giving them all the power and ease in the world. A trope for teaching characters a lesson can be making them God for a day.\n\nThe character may love it at first, indulge in several whims, fulfill some wishes but then they may find themselves getting Drunk with Power or finding that Being God Is Hard and they can't handle all the responsibilities associated with the power so well, each well meaning move being a blunder that leads to more to fix. These difficulties may cause a Sudden Humility. If things turn disastrous, expect an Aesop about how Reality Warping Is Not a Toy.\n\nIf the character can handle the responsibility but becomes bored with having everything at his beck and call, being a god for a day can become similar to Victory Is Boring in that things are now easy for the character and he wonders how best to use his powers when everything comes so easily to him with his omnipotence. The character's newfound power might also lead to isolation and emptiness resulting in a case of being Lonely at the Top. Sometimes, in such a situation, the character may end up giving half of his/her powers to someone else so that he could have an equal.\n\nThe difficulty for the writer lies in figuring out how to make being in charge difficult. The story can fail if the powers given don't match up properly to the original owner in an overcontrived manner that forces a failure or if the character is being too limited by their own Idiot Ball and not something genuinely inherent to the power.\n\nCompare: Subbing for Santa.
