The more experienced character then goes to lengths to explain just how not cool that experience would actually be. He or she then asks the Na\u00efve Newcomer if they still think it would be cool. Unless it's a subversion, the answer is generally a resounding \"no\". (And contexts in which it the answer would be yes would be a Blunt \"Yes\" by their very nature.)\n\nUseful in many functions of drama. For one, it immediately shows the more experienced character to be the older and wiser of the two. It may be used in a Deconstruction to show just how awful a seemingly incredibly cool thing would be in real life. And of course, it can actually be quite funny to see the more experienced character completely terrify the younger one with a horrifically descriptive summary of the activity as the younger one desperately tries to backpedal on their stance.\n\nA common version is for the New Meat imagining that War Is Glorious to be corrected by the Shell-Shocked Veteran that no, War Is Hell.\n\nOf course, frequently it's subverted as the younger character places a rebuttal on exactly why it is still cool. Or, when the \"fun\" is particularly nasty, having that character think it fun because of all the trouble it brings.\n\nAlso see Wasn't That Fun?", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThatSoundLikeFunToYou", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ExterminatusNow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Shrek", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HalfBaked", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IndependenceDay", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLastSamurai", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PitchBlack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheChroniclesOfRiddick", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EscapeFromButcherBay", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Wolfhound", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderRyuki", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TerminatorTheSarahConnorChronicles", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/AlicesRestaurant", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ChzoMythos", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect1", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearSolid2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MetalGearRisingRevengeance", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokerNightAtTheInventory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SamAndMax", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ExterminatusNow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Spiderman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewScoobyDooMovies", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RhetoricalQuestionBlunder", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NaiveNewcomer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BluntYes", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMeat", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsGlorious", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsHell", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFetishist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasntThatFun", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeconstructorFleet", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CentralTheme", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindScrew", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Area51", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RetCon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pegasus", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadFuture", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaximumFunChamber", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessIsMandatory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkWorld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoonyFan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PsychoForHire", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/PennyArcade", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManlyTears", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheDog", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlanetKiller", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImAManICantHelpIt", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllMenArePerverts", "http://exterminatusnow.co.uk/2008-07-26/comic/mort-to-it-than-zombies/for-cheap-thrills-just-add-voodoo/", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/ImAMarvelAndImADC", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroWorshipper", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrokenAce", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInSourArmor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DyingAlone", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR2c8r6jgMQ&t=3m38s", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InkSuitActor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InSpace", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMenInBlack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeelingPotatoes", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmnJF7QjxXg"]}
