She's amazing at finding things.\" She said \"If your Mum could find them, she must be a miracle worker.\"They'll be staring her in the face. They always are.They were in the fridge.\n\nIf someone loses an object, it will always be found in the last place they look. Fridge Logic maintains that this is because once they find it, they aren't looking for it any more, thus it's always in the last place they look. What they really mean is that it's the last place they would look.\n\nThe main example of this is when a character loses their glasses. They will always, inevitably, have them on their head. Works with keys, books, and pretty much anything you can hold in your hand.\n\nMay frequently involve being Hidden in Plain Sight. The character may also have Failed a Spot Check. As many folks can attest, this is Truth in Television.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastPlaceYouLook", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/XiaolinShowdown", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MirrorMask", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ThePrinceOfTennis", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SgtFrog", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MirrorMask", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Spaced", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EmmetOttersJugBandChristmas", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FawltyTowers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JustShootMe", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThirtyRock", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BlackBooks", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TwoAndAHalfMen", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffFoxworthy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shade", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StrongBadsCoolGameForAttractivePeople", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WhereMyHatIsAt", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TwoStupidDogs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DoraTheExplorer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGrimAdventuresOfBillyAndMandy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/PonyDotMov", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWithoutEm", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenInPlainSight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceProcedural", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StalkerWithACrush", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWithoutEm", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/PonyDotMov", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoDS", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Zits", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExtremeDoormat", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TearJerker", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InteractiveFiction", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastPlaceYouLook", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaQueen", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroppedGlasses", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlindWithoutEm"]}
