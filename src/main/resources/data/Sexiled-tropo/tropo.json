In other words, they've been sexiled, and once this is established we are often treated to the sight of the one being sexiled sitting around waiting to be let back in.\n\nCommon visual shorthand usually includes some item being placed on the doorknob or directly outside the door. Common variants include a tie or hair scrunchy, though people may develop their own personal signals that range from the mundane to the outrageous. These basically serve as a substitute for the \"Do Not Disturb\" sign.\n\nOf course, breaking a sexile is a prime opportunity for hilarity to ensue.\n\nNot to be confused with Exiled to the Couch, when someone is kept out of their own bedroom (and by implication, denied sex) or Lysistrata Gambit, which is about withholding sex as leverage in negotiation.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Sexiled", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MacrossFrontier", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RevengeOfTheNerds", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheApartment", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GinzaCosmetics", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScottPilgrimVsTheWorld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Phffft", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TinCup", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheInbetweeners", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThief", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCrossing2015", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Undeclared", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWaltons", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMiddleman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/IDreamOfJeannie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWestWing", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheFreshPrinceOfBelAir", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSims", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Drowtales", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Candi", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Xkcd", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DumbingOfAge", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/QuestionableContent", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/StickyDillyBuns", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfMU", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Undergrads", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaughtWithYourPantsDown", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExiledToTheCouch", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LysistrataGambit", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LysistrataGambit", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike", "https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11898648/43/Harry-Potter-and-the-Rune-Stone-Path", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipUpgrade", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DashingHispanic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllGirlsWantBadBoys", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IncrediblyLamePun", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneIsBi", "http://www.webcomicsnation.com/shaenongarrity/smithson/series.php?view=archive&chapter=3495", "http://www.candicomics.com/d/20040813.html", "http://xkcd.com/658/", "http://www.dumbingofage.com/2014/comic/book-4/01-the-only-dope-for-me-is-you/need/", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeShoes", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac", "http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=2164", "http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=2685", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GayBestFriend", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexWithTheEx", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DormLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PingPongNaivete", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ADateWithRosiePalms"]}
