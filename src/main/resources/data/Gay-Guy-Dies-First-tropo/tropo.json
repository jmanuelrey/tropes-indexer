{"title": "Gay Guy Dies First", "content": "This work has filled out its cast of the hero, the hero's friends with characterization, and a bunch of token stereotypes. They add variety. Of course, if this work also likes to kill off characters then the first to go will be one of these expendables, only brought in to hit the token targets without really caring for what they mean. Given Hollywood's interesting track record with gay characters, you can almost guarantee that if it's not the preppy screaming girl or the black dude dying first, it's the gay guy.\n\nOne reason it may be done specifically (rather than just the excuse of bumping off the side characters) is to bury the gays. It may seem that only one gay character died compared to the straight ones, but he was probably the only gay character and he was gone in the first 2 minutes. It counts, as a work-based prejudice kill. It stops the gay character meaning much, except as someone that is weak or obviously should be the first to die.\n\nThere's also the possibility, like with most minority characters dying early, that the typically straight white male writers have no idea how to handle the character and kill them off so they don't have to make much of an attempt.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this trope can sometimes cause controversy due to Unfortunate Implications.\n\nNote that we're using 'gay' to refer to LGBT+ people of all colors.\n\nSee also: Black Dude Dies First, Vasquez Always Dies.
