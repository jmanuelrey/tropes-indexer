{"title": "Dawn of the Wild West", "content": "Sub-trope of The Western, Dawn of the Wild West involves stories set in the western part of North America between the late 1700s and the 1840s which was a time of continental exploration (e.g., Lewis and Clark), fur trapping, trailblazing, and westward expansion.\n\nIn stories covered by this trope, you'll usually encounter bold explorers, mountain men, missionaries, and Native Americans. The latter's depiction will vary considerably and be often colored by the attitudes from the time the work was produced.\n\nThere are also stories about pioneers under this trope but their efforts to settle and civilize the \"savage\" land often involve wilderness that's east of the Mississippi. Stories about pioneers moving into the Far West (i.e., the North American Great Plains and territory west of the Rockies) signify the end of the time period covered under Dawn of the Wild West trope (i.e., the early 1840s).\n\nIn addition, this trope covers works about the Battle of the Alamo and the Texas War for Independence.\n\nAs indicated in the title, this trope covers the beginning of the period covered in the Wild West and represents the Dawn of an Era. It's the opposite of Twilight of the Old West which covers the End of an Age for the Wild West.\n\u2022 DC Comics Hawk, Son of Tomahawk was about the half-Indian son of the Revolutionary War hero Tomahawk and was set in the early years of the 19th Century in the American midwest.\n\u2022 Tejano was a back-up feature that ran in Jonah Hex about the exploits of a band of Texas Rangers during the days of the Texas Republic.\n\u2022 Writer Ren\u00e9 Goscinny and artist Albert Uderzo launched a year before they started working on Asterix.
