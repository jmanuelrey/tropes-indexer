{"title": "Peter Pan Parody", "content": "While Peter Pan is not the first of his kind \u2014 an eternally young trickster in a Fantasy Land \u2014 to grace the world of fiction, Peter Pan can be considered a Trope Codifier for many when it comes to this general character. Many of the criteria for this trope as follows:\n\u2022 They are Older Than They Look, often taking the form of a child or teenager but staying just below the physical and mental capacity of adulthood, Not Allowed to Grow Up. Sometimes this is in their blood, being some type of The Fair Folk or other magical beings, while in other cases it is in what they eat or whatever world they call home. Being eternally young, they are often stunted behavior wise, making them come across as a Manchild or are Innocently Insensitive, a Sociopathic Hero if it is really prominent.\n\u2022 They act as The Trickster, with their propensity for playing pranks and other forms of mischief ranging from harmless to questionable to malignant.\n\u2022 The power of flight. The ability to fly is often used as a metaphor for a child's capacity to imagine, freedom from gravity the ultimate form of rebellion from Earthly concerns and the ultimate way to play. In some cases, they bestow this ability on their companions.\n\u2022 Usually keeps exclusively to the company of children. In positive terms, they are their protector, looking after them when their parents are unable to and keeping them company when they are lonely, similar to an Imaginary Friend. If negative terms are set-in, their motivations are usually more selfish and malignant, getting children in trouble by tempting them to misbehave, or worse; taking them away from their family and loved ones off to whatever twisted Never Land they hail from, robbing them of their loved ones and their ability to grow-up, possibly for all of eternity.\n\u2022 References to the Elizabeth Tower (sometimes still called \"Big Ben\" by the uninformed), because it is iconic to the Disney movie, and the Disney adaptation is the most famous.\n\nCompare with the other Captain Ersatz/Expy Stock Parodies including Alice Allusion and Off to See the Wizard.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeterPanParody", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/PeterPan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/PeterPan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheEternals", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungJustice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superboy1994", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RiseOfTheGuardians", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheLegendOfZelda", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaOcarinaOfTime", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NiGHTSIntoDreams", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SisterClaire", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangeHillHigh"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/FantasyLand", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheyLook", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAllowedToGrowUp", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manchild", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnocentlyInsensitive", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SociopathicHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendToAllChildren", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImaginaryFriend", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToxicFriendInfluence", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheKindnapper", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverLand", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockTower", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CaptainErsatz", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Expy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockParodies", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliceAllusion", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffToSeeTheWizard", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairyCompanion", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClockTower", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AvatarTheLastAirbenderTheEmberIslandPlayers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrapThereAreFanficsOfUs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterExaggeration", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure"]}
