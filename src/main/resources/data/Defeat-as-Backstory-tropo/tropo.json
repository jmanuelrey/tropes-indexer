{"title": "Defeat as Backstory", "content": "\"He had seen Hoare depart and John-John Peters take over, had quarreled with Peters and driven north to join Denard at Paulis, had been in the Stanleyville mutiny two years later and, after the Frenchman's evacuation to Rhodesia with head wounds, had joined Black Jacques Schramme, the Belgian planter-turned-mercenary, on the long march to Bukavu and thence to Kigali. After repatriation by the Red Cross, he had promptly volunteered for another African war and had finally taken command of his own battalion. But too late to win, always too late to win.\"\n\nA protagonist (or some other character's backstory) in a story begins by having been defeated either before the story began, or early on in the story (often in a prologue). While this usually applies to a character having fought on the losing side of a war, it can also apply to someone having lost an important game as an athlete. This defeat forms a significant aspect of that character; fighting on the losing side may have closed doors for that character, or they may be burning for revenge, or they're trying to pick up the pieces and move on. If a character is trying overly hard to prevent a similar defeat from happening again, then they are a Failure Knight. If someone is Sealed Evil in a Can, they will have by design a previous defeat as part of their backstory (that's how they managed to get sealed into a can, after all).", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefeatAsBackstory", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDogsOfWar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FistOfTheNorthStar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GenesisClimberMospeada", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Tsukipro", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Cars", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars3", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CreedII", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/RockyIV", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CrossOfIron", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheEmpireStrikesBack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHiddenFortress", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ItHappenedHere", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StrayDog", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMightyDucks", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDarkTower", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDogsOfWar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MistbornTheOriginalTrilogy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HellOnWheels", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GodOfWarI", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendOfZeldaBreathOfTheWild", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicForces", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Revenge", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailureKnight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInACan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingTheEarth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmoralAttorney", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromNobodyToNightmare", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligiousBruiser", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyOfBlackMagic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellShockedVeteran", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResurrectiveImmortality", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AwfulTruth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGreatestFailure", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/BlazBlue"]}
