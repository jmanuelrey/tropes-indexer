{"title": "Where's My Gun?", "content": "So you're a soldier, lying in the middle of your base with nothing to do. Your tasks for the day are done, and you lay down to take a nap... when suddenly the enemy decides to attack, and throws the place into absolute chaos. Making matters worse... where's your gun? This trope has come to pass, and it is a massive Oh, Crap! to any poor unfortunate soldier or policeman that has it happen to them.\n\nThis trope basically occurs any time a character has to spend time looking for his weapon (and possibly getting killed in the process) when he should be doing something a bit more useful, like ya know, fighting. Sometimes however, it plays out because the gun in question is special to him, and he refuses to use anything else, even when there's piles of usable rifles at his feet.\n\nDoesn't necessarily have to be a firearm, any time a character loses a weapon of any sort can certainly count here. A Properly Paranoid character trying to defy this trope will often feel like they Can't Bathe Without a Weapon.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WheresMyGun", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/EnemyAtTheGates", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/VanHelsing", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ActOfValor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Halo4ForwardUntoDawn", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheForest", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreedII", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemAwakening", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TombRaiderAnniversary"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProperlyParanoid", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DefiedTrope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantBatheWithoutAWeapon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoomHeadshot", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilverBullet", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/WatchGirlsPlay", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigScaryBlackMan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Machinima/RedVsBlue", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GunsInChurch"]}
