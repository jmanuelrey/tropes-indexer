{"title": "Saloon Owner", "content": "The Saloon is where all men and women gather after a rough day out in the west, to make sure the place keeps the taps a flowing, the dancers dancing and the wenches wenching. The Saloon Owner is the guy to turn to. He is often connected to everything that goes on within the pub from the Bounty Hunter who just came by for quick respite being finding his quarry, the Railroad Baron who has come to get frisky with one of the dancers or The Gunslinger who just busted several jawbones. The Saloon owner is a pimp, crime boss, and owner of an ill establishment.\n\nThe Saloon owner has two different varieties, sometimes he is the somewhat sympathetic owner of a pub and is willing to help the sheriff (or some other heroic character) out for the right price. Other times he is a ruthless bastard who cares for nothing but power and is the de facto mayor of the town and this is his barracks as the clients are more than willing to help him for free service.\n\nIf the Saloon Owner's a miss, she is usually of the kinder sort, but not always. But you best be warned, most of the people working there are their eyes and ears. So depending on their moral fabric, some may bring you in to the deputy and others will use you for their personal gain.\n\nSee also: Miss Kitty. May overlap with The Bartender, but usually, the bartender is hired help.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SaloonOwner", "media_links": ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JoanCrawford", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JohnnyGuitar", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Tombstone", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unforgiven", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Yojimbo", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ATreeGrowsInBrooklyn", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheStarWarsHolidaySpecial", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DrQuinnMedicineWoman", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AnAmericanTail"], "non_media_links": ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BountyHunter", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RailroadBaron", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGunslinger", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissKitty", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBartender", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoNameGiven", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JadedWashout", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Lampshades", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeIrish", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGhoulsAreDifferent", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOwnThisTown", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadBoss"]}
