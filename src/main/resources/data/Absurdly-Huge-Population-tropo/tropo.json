{"title": "Absurdly Huge Population", "content": "The individual human being is unpredictable, but the reactions of human mobs, Seldon found, could be treated statistically. The larger the mob, the greater the accuracy that could be achieved. And the size of the human masses that Seldon worked with was no less than the population of the Galaxy which in his time was numbered in the quintillions.\n\nIt's the future- either close or distant. You have the ray guns, the jet packs, and the spaceships. But you need a way of making things seem more 'real', more grounded in reality. How?\n\nUp the population by a couple of billions, that's how! Despite Earth's current population growth slowing down and estimated to peter out around between the 9th to the 13th billion barring outside influence as third-world developing countries go through the four stages of demographic transition , the concept of 'of course there will be more people in the future, duh!' is one that seems self-evident to many readers, and thus it is an easy way to get across how far into the future you are, with populations only growing bigger as you get further and further into the future. These populations will often be so mind-bogglingly huge that they are unfathomable to our current worldview.\n\nHow such a large population came to be or is sustained, is rarely addressed, though there's sometimes an in-show justification (often involving colonizing other planets and simply needing more people to populate them so a modern society could function). It's popular in space operas with their sprawling space filling empires.\n\nThis trope can easily collide with Science Marches On and Society Marches On, since figures which match this trope in older fiction can these days be not just plausible, but reality. Make Room! Make Room! has seven billion people on Earthnote Which we reached late October 2011, while Isaac Asimov's short story \"The Winnowing\" has humanity starving at sixnote Of the 7.5 billion people of today, a little less than 800 million are starving , a number that's falling despite the increase in population; this leaves us with 6.7 billion people who have food on their plate.\n\nOften overlaps with Overpopulation Crisis when the enormous population size begins to cause problems, but settings can have massive populations without suffering negative consequences as well.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsurdlyHugePopulation", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SecondFoundation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MakeRoomMakeRoom", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFifthElement", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheForceAwakens", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SoylentGreen", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HarryHarrison", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Foundation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ThePsychohistorians", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FoundationsEdge", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLastQuestion", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TwentyFourHundredThirtyAD", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Aeon14", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertSilverberg", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWorldInside", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/StandOnZanzibar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStarchildTrilogy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/FrederikPohl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackWilliamson", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KrisLongknife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtVonnegut", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedQueen", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheOuterLimits1963", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/EVNova", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarCraft", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GalacticCivilizations", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SchlockMercenary"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RayGun", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JetPack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolSpaceship", "http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.GROW", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceOpera", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFillingEmpire", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScienceMarchesOn", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SocietyMarchesOn", "http://www.worldhunger.org/2015-world-hunger-and-poverty-facts-and-statistics/", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverpopulationCrisis", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Doomsayer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InTheFutureHumansWillBeOneRace", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityPlanet", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Millennial_Project:_Colonizing_the_Galaxy_in_Eight_Easy_Steps", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrescienceByAnalysis", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaExposita", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgriWorld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literatrue/TheGeneralFoundation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgriWorld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VestigialEmpire", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InfoDump", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WritersCannotDoMath", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CityPlanet", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStarsAreGoingOut", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceStation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS8E4ColonyInSpace", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheOuterLimits1963S2E5DemonWithAGlassHand", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForeverWar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeHaveReserves", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Arcology", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonyShip", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ColonizedSolarSystem", "http://www.schlockmercenary.com/2014-07-08", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreenAesop", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotHyperbole", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebOriginal/OrionsArm", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndangeredSpecies"]}
