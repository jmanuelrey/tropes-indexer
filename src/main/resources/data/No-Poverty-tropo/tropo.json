{"title": "No Poverty", "content": "A setting with No Poverty has no poor. Take a moment to parse that sentence. Something which has eluded human civilization has been achieved: this is a world where no one is homeless, everyone eats three full meals a day, and society casts no one out. The elderly, physically and mentally ill are cared for, and just about everyone willing has ways to contribute to the society despite not being forced to. Either the social structure is no longer a pyramid at all, or it's a hierarchy with an exceptionally wide and inclusive base which is not a bad place to be and does not differ qualitatively from higher layers. Considering inequality is as old as human society itself, the authors are unlikely to take lightly such a change to the human condition; it's usually treated as a pretty big deal. The weight and appeal of this idea is such that many writers will use it as the central premise to their setting, and may even pen a full blown Author Tract about the way their Utopia came to be, is organized, and may yet be improved still.\n\nUsually the key to a post-scarcity future revolves around technology. Maybe Alternate Universe Reed Richards Is Awesome, The Singularity brought total equality, matter replicators and infinite energy machines made scarcity disappear. Other authors are convinced that we don't even need that and it's a matter of distributing what humanity already has; thus, their works feature an Author Avatar revolutionary philosopher/economist showing up to teach humanity a new way to go about civilization that doesn't marginalize anyone. Whatever the case, someone(s) have made it so that characters can only be poor or indigent by choice, and can almost effortlessly access a support network that would elevate them out of it. If characters native to this setting encounter a vagrant or someone in poverty (this may require Time Travel, visiting alien worlds, or going to a remote and uncivilized place) they'll be confused and horrified at the concept (and running into active slavery will cause fits).\n\nExpect these kinds of worlds to be called out as Mary Suetopias. Authors can potentially minimize this trope and use it only as a minor part of the Backstory of their setting, making only passing references to how it was achieved. This is likely a form of Conservation of Detail to avoid distracting viewers from the focus of the story (like space exploration or magical adventures). The risk here is that treating it too glibly may make viewers lose their Willing Suspension of Disbelief \"Wait, you're telling me nanomachines made everyone rich? How?!\" Furthermore, an additional issue that is rarely pointed out is that even with an environment in which everyone has more money, there would still likely be an inequality of income. It would just be that there would be more goods overall and the rich would now have even higher extravagant displays of wealth, but no one would particularly care about that as everyone's needs and most of the wants are satisfied.\n\nIt's also possible that rather than being applied to humans, this trope will be used by aliens, fantasy races, or a subgroup of humanity. There may be some Cultural Posturing involved on the part of these peoples.\n\nAnd then there's always the subversion where the lack of poverty was achieved at the cost of society becoming a Dystopia.\n\nCompare and contrast Eat the Rich, Kill the Poor.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoPoverty", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/No6", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SupermanRedSon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Planetary", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DCOneMillion", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheFlash", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HotFuzz", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarTrekFirstContact", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VorkosiganSaga", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IvanYefremov", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AndromedaNebula", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCulture", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JamesPHogan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheKingkillerChronicle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCavesOfSteel", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheNakedSun", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRobotsOfDawn", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EighthDoctorAdventures", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Island1962", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ALF", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DuneChroniclesOfTheImperium", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HostileWatersAntaeusRising", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Portal2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SidMeiersAlphaCentauri", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVI", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/LeftoverSoup", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JamesBond"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorTract", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateUniverseReedRichardsIsAwesome", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSingularity", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatterReplicator", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAvatar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeTravel", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySuetopia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConservationOfDetail", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WillingSuspensionOfDisbelief", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Nanomachines", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturalPosturing", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatTheRich", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillThePoor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdvancedAncientAcropolis", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WithStringsAttached", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StepfordSuburbia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContinuitySnarl", "http://www.ansible.co.uk/books/3mill.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrolife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenerationShips", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThatsNoMoon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Backstory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Magitek", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeleportersAndTransporters", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WorthlessYellowRocks", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllJustADream", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingWithATrope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeirdCurrency", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurGoblinsAreDifferent", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LargeAndInCharge", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MightMakesRight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScaryDogmaticAliens", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNeedsOfTheMany", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WretchedHive", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesNotLikeMen", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS8E2YouOnlyMoveTwice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoDelaysForTheWicked"]}
