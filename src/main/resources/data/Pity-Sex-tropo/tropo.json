{"title": "Pity Sex", "content": "Tsubame offers to sleep with Ishigami after the Christmas party in order to soften the blow of her turning down his Love Confession , but he just storms out because he doesn't want his first time to be with someone who doesn't love him the same way he loves them. When Miko rightfully points out that doing so probably hurt Tsubame just as badly as she hurt him, he's so depressed that he doesn't bother trying to break his fall when he trips down the stairs. The only reason he's not dead is because Miko realized he might try to do something stupid and caught him (breaking her arm in the process).", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PitySex", "media_links": [], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveConfession"]}
