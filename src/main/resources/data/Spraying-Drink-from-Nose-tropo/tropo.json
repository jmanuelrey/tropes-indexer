{"title": "Spraying Drink from Nose", "content": "\"Needless to say I had to mop up the milk I had been drinking, 'cause it was on the other side of the room! Which is pretty good distance through your nose!\"\n\nYour nose and mouth are linked, in fact they're even linked (via your sinuses) to your eyes. So when Bob is taking a big swig of his nice nutritional milk and Alice makes Bob laugh there are only a few places that milk can go. You either choke, spit it out or, through the magic of pressure, force the milk out of your nose. None of these are a good look (and are in fact rather painful if you've ever actually had it happen to you), but if you can manage to get it out your eyes then you may get on TV so it's not all bad.\n\nUsually a comedy trope. More common with younger children because, well they're generally happy anyway, and not restricted to milk; fizzy drinks, coffee, tea....vomit all can be yours to smell for the rest of the day.\n\nCompare Spit Take, where it comes out your mouth instead and usually is caused by surprise rather than laughter.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SprayingDrinkFromNose", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Incredibles2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Pokemon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffFoxworthy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BlueCollarComedy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeffFoxworthy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InsideOut", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Incredibles2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HudsonHawk", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JunieBJones", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/NotAlwaysRight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AllGrownUp", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfJimmyNeutronBoyGenius"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpitTake", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/LeDonjonDeNaheulbeuk", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield", "http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1993/ga930320.gif", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CallBack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater", "http://www.gocomics.com/garfield/1998/07/31", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvokedTrope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Zits", "http://zitscomics.com/comics/september-22-2001/", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/AChangedWorld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCasanova", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/StrongBadEmail", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZanyScheme", "https://notalwaysright.com/has-the-balls-to-admit-it", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiccupHijinks", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjyk7nKJxH8", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassClown", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverybodyLaughsEnding", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BananaPeel"]}
