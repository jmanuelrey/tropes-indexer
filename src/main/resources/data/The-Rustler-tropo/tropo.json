{"title": "The Rustler", "content": "The Evil Counterpart of the Cowboy who uses the same skill set to steal livestock, primarily cattle and horses. While livestock thievery is nearly as old as domesticated animals themselves, the Rustler does it wholesale.\n\nThere are the two-bit versions, who steal a few cattle to sell for pocket change, but real Rustlers come in two versions:\n\u2022 Hit and Run: This is essentially an action packed attack on a herd of cattle (often on a Cattle Drive or during a Round-Up). The rustlers stampede the cattle, shooting their guns, often killing or injuring the Heroes, and then the Rustlers round up the largest bunch of cattle, and start their own Cattle Drive \u2014 sometimes towards Mexico. This is the open highway banditry version.\n\u2022 Rebranding: This is more of a mystery version. Cattle are disappearing from the ranch, more than can be explained by Mountain Lions, Wolves, and Indians. Essentially one of the other ranchers in the area is stealing cattle by pasting their brand over the top of the rightful owners' brand. Expect talk about using a \"running iron\" and for particularly skilled re-branders the use of a Saddle Bag cinch ring.\n\nOf course, it shouldn't be that difficult to figure out who is stealing as the new brand has to be close to the old brand so that it can cover it up. (For example, covering a \"Lazy S\" brand with a \"Lazy 8\" brand \u2014 you just extend the S to turn it into an 8). Sometimes there are so many brands running around that there are multiple suspects. The definitive proof is usually killing a cow with a suspicious brand, skinning it, and looking at the hide from the inside. (Somehow you can tell). Of course, both the innocent and the guilty tend to protest the killing of their cattle.\n\nSometimes everybody knows what is going on, but the rebranding keeps it from being open theft, and people live with it because the thief either has political connections, or has hired The Gunslinger as his Dragon. Sometimes both. Often a Determined Homesteader or Lone Rancher stood up to him and got himself killed, leaving behind a Determined Widow. Then The Drifter shows up...\n\nOh, and the penalty for Rustling? Hanging.\n\nUsually without the preamble of a trial, but in more law-abiding communities they do haul them in to go before a Hanging Judge, and a jury made up of Townsmen and Cowboys. (On the Scottish Border, summary execution was permitted to anyone who caught a raider with the spoil still in his care. They say Western folk are often descendants of Borderers...)\n\nPretty much always villains in a Western. Compare Evil Poacher.
