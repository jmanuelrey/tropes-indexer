{"title": "Visual Novel Shot", "content": "This trope is an Anime Manga exclusive.\n\nIn some scenes with couples, there will be a static background shot of a school facility (usually a hallway or yard) or any home/urban/park area, with a vanishing point (generally centered), representing the protagonist's point of view. In the foreground there's a medium shot of almost always a female character with a shy or gentle expression. This is known as the \"standing image\", in which the character can only be seen in the front usually from the head to the waist.\n\nSimilar to a standard Dating Sim or Visual Novel screen (as well as many Flash games). This shot is commonly used as a device to imply romantic involvement.\n\nMight or not have the menu options and decorative frames (in which case it's a parody).\n\u2022 Commonly found in Kyoto Animation's anime adaptations of Key/Visual Arts games, such as Kanon and CLANNAD.\n\u2022 In Clannad, some of the jokes were conserved as Tomoya having a random Imagine Spot about what option would he choose if this where a visual novel, and it was shown on screen with an actual scene from another Key game Little Busters!.\n\u2022 Excel Saga has an entire episode framed around Il Pallazo playing a dating sim and Excel having to live through the choices he makes. The third choice is always \"Put it in\", not that he ever chooses it.\n\u2022 In the final episode, there's a brief return of these shots... and all the options are \"Put It In\".\n\u2022 Kimi ni Todoke: Our lovely Sawako shows us how it's done in the picture.\n\u2022 There's also a Dating Sim Shot with Saki in the Genshiken manga (and Madarame too).\n\u2022 My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute has the male lead introduced to dating sims (against his will), after which he starts seeing menu options whenever he faces a decision. One scene has a shot of his father that matches this trope format.\n\u2022 Love Hina: Specifically Motoko's introduction is very much shot using this type of framing.\n\u2022 Megatokyo uses it in a panel to show what happens when Piro (the artist, not the character) manages to knock Largo out in creative disputes. In the reverse situation, the comic looks like a First-Person Shooter. (That was before Largo's actual departure)\n\u2022 Seen in The World God Only Knows (of course).\n\u2022 When the members of Seitokai no Ichizon were discussing Kurimu's bad grades, Sugisaki imagines himself playing the scene out in one of his games. He chooses to save and click the 'hug' option to start a sex scene.\n\u2022 Kannagi, episode 11: Takako visualizes Jin's life with Nagi, Tsugumi and Zange as this.\n\u2022 Episode 8 of Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions features this type of shot with Rikka.\n\u2022 The anime and manga database site Anilist parodies this trope by putting a rather funny 404 page (only for registered users).", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovelShot", "media_links": ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiNiTodoke", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KyotoAnimation", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KeyVisualArts", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Kanon", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Clannad", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LittleBusters", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ExcelSaga", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KimiNiTodoke", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Genshiken", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Oreimo", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Megatokyo", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TheWorldGodOnlyKnows", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/SeitokaiNoIchizon", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Kannagi", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/LoveChunibyoAndOtherDelusions"], "non_media_links": ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DatingSim", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisualNovel", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstPersonShooter", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FunnyAneurysmMoment", "https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/i1no6ed.jpg"]}
