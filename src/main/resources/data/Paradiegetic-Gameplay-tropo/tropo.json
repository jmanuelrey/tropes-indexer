Sometimes, though, a puzzle's solution involves something that isn't in the game itself, and beating it will require you to do something that isn't just pressing buttons on your keyboard or controller. Maybe it involves a phone number you have to call, or you need to fiddle with the date and time in Windows settings, or press the \"eject\" button on your CD drive. This is where this trope comes in.\n\nThese types of puzzles may lead to Guide Dang It! since most people often don't expect this sort of gameplay.\n\nSometimes these types of puzzles are done as a form of Copy Protection, having Feelies bundled with a physical copy of the game with an answer to a puzzle to prevent those who downloaded the game on the Internet to solve it and continue.\n\nExtrinsic Go-First Rule is a subtrope.

Opening it up would begin a minigame where you close the DS again and use the L and R buttons to help Daffy chase after the beast (who turns out to be Gossamer). Arbitrarily, you could only try this once per day; after that it would go into Sleep Mode as normal.\n\u2022 In Doki Doki Literature Club! you defeat Monika by deleting her character file.

Each Japanese rerelease changes it so Pols Voice can be killed with a different method, such as pressing Select 4 times in the GBA version, or pressing L and R to virtually \"switch\" to the second controller and yell into the 3DS's microphone in the 3DS version. In all English releases, including the NES version, the enemy is instead weak to arrows.\n\u2022 In The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, at one point you're required to transfer a seal on the DS's top screen to its corresponding location on the map on your lower screen by closing your DS and reopening it.\n\u2022 The Nintendo DS version of Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors has an upside-down Sudoku puzzle that requires you to turn your DS upside down.

When you load your game, The End will be dead from old age.\n\u2022 In the Monster Rancher PlayStation games, Monsters are created from \"saucer stones\". In-game, these are artifacts from which the monsters are generated in a lab; out of game, the player has to put a different CD or game disc into the PlayStation, which generates the monster's stats from its subcode data. Later games in the line add different input methods, like the DS microphone and touchscreen.\n\u2022 Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire: The infamous puzzle to get all three of the legendary golems has a lot of this. In addition to needing very specific pokemon, which have to be in specific places in your party, you need to be able to read braille in text form to follow the clues in each of the chambers.\n\u2022 Save the Date will always result in a bad ending unless you edit one of the game files to make yourself a \"hacker\" .\n\u2022 The MMORPG The Secret World is so loaded with these that they gave you a working in-game web browser.

Another requires you to leave the game on all day on a Tuesday.\n\u2022 To obtain the secret code in StarTropics, you're supposed to make the invisible ink on one of the game's Feelies appear.
