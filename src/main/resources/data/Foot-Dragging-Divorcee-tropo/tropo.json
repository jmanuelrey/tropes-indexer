{"title": "Foot-Dragging Divorcee", "content": "Couples in fiction who get divorced generally do so in only two ways. Either they hate each other so much as to fight viciously over every piece of property and terms of child custody, or else it's a unilateral decision which the other spouse, still in love with their partner, can't quite bring himself (and it usually is the husband, which statistically is Truth in Television more often than not) to conclude. The divorce papers will lie conspicuously on the foot-dragger's desk, still sealed in their manila envelope, until the very end of the deadline for submission. The would-be ex will pester them to get it done, often because they're planning to marry someone else and the wedding date is fast approaching.\n\nWhen the papers finally do get signed, it's usually after the reluctant spouse has some plot-inspired epiphany about how he needs to get on with his life, set his partner free to live hers, or otherwise accept that it's over. Either that, or the foot-dragger meets a new Love Interest of his own, possibly as a Pair the Spares.\n\nSubversions often end up being a Comedy of Remarriage. Aversions in which a two-timer claims to his or her lover that their spouse is a foot-dragger, but actually has no intention to divorce at all, are also common.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FootDraggingDivorcee", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RobinSeries", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Twister", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SecretWindow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SweetHomeAlabama", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SanAndreas", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AWolfInTheSoul", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CriminalMinds", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Friends", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bones", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoyalPains", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Eureka", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSpecialVictimsUnit", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheXFiles", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OneLifeToLive", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AsTheWorldTurns", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lucifer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Sleuth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HitmanBloodMoney", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/MyMagicalDivorceBureau"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DivorceAssetsConflict", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SolomonDivorce", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IWantMyBelovedToBeHappy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnowWhenToFoldEm", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PairTheSpares", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedyOfRemarriage", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComedyOfRemarriage", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/AngelS01E07BachelorParty", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PutOnABus", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrophyWife", "http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/516/stuck-in-the-middle"]}
