I'm trying to signify something to you here.\n\nLaura: Will you excuse me for a moment?\n\nGiardella: Yeah, sure. Do you gotta go to the bathroom or something? Yeah, you know where it is. Yeah, it's right over there. Just help yourself.\n\nGiardella: [through the door] - Yeah, you know, and if I come back, uh, we could drive wherever, you know. Maybe one of them, uh, breakfast and board places in them quaint areas. You know, one of them places with the quilts on the bed and, uh, those pictures of the whaling guys. One of these days, all this bouncing around like a cue ball is gonna stop. I'm gonna get myself set up somewhere. Out west, maybe. Can you hear me, Laura? You fall in in there?", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiterallyLaughableQuestion", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NYPDBlue"], "non_media_links": ["https://youtu.be/w1oLTs9ObMs?t=13m46s"]}
