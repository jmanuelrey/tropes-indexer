{"title": "Born During A Storm", "content": "This trope is when a baby is born while a storm rages outside. Not only does it add flair to a childbirth scene, the Dramatic Wind, rain/snow, Dramatic Thunder, and lightning thematically reflect the pain of the mother as she tries to bring her child into the world \u2014 bonus points if it's a Screaming Birth. By the time the birth is over the storm will usually have passed and the mother can hold her child in peace, although there may be added tension regarding how to keep the baby safe should the storm cut off access to utilities or access to society.\n\nThis trope is used to mark a character as special as it's a dramatic and exciting start to their life \u2014 indeed, a woman might give birth during the Big Storm Episode for no reason other than Rule of Drama. This is doubly so if the storm is supernatural in nature. At the very least, the baby's life will be dramatic and exciting to match their birth; they may also have some weather-related name to match. This also juxtaposes the death and destruction caused by severe storms with the birth of new life \u2014 see Birth/Death Juxtaposition and Life/Death Juxtaposition.\n\nIf the baby is born at the beginning, this may be mixed with It Was a Dark and Stormy Night. If the mother is also in danger as she's giving birth (eg. she's trapped outside in the storm), it overlaps with Maternity Crisis. For when lightning itself brings forth life, see Lightning Can Do Anything.\n\nThere is some Truth in Television to this: it's an old wives' tale that storms induce labor, and several locations claim surges in births during hurricanes, typhoons, blizzards, or other storms. In modern times, heavily pregnant women in safe zones sometimes head to hospitals as a precaution. However, there are very few studies that decisively link between natural disasters and the so-called \"disaster baby boom\". What causes this supposed increase in labor, if anything, is so far unknown \u2014 earlier theories had to do with drops in barometric pressure, while others purport that it has to do with stress or temperature.\n\nNot to be confused with Child of the Storm.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BornDuringAStorm", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BabiesAndOtherHazardsOfSex", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Georgie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/LaytonMysteryDetectiveAgency", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/OneHundredAndOneDalmatians", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hours", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRockyHorrorPictureShow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhereTheHeartIs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DaveBarry", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BabiesAndOtherHazardsOfSex", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/East", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RonjaTheRobbersDaughter", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSilverBrumby", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ASongOfIceAndFire", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WarriorCats", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheNightShift", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MartyRobbins", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheRollingStones", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWeather", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/StrongFemaleProtagonist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDragonPrince", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticWind", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DramaticThunder", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmpathicEnvironment", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScreamingBirth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigStormEpisode", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfDrama", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MeaningfulName", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirthDeathJuxtaposition", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LifeDeathJuxtaposition", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasADarkAndStormyNight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaternityCrisis", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightningCanDoAnything", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ChildOfTheStorm", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasADarkAndStormyNight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/KyoshiRising", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirthDeathJuxtaposition", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheLionOfTheNorth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Discworld/EqualRites", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigStormEpisode", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScreamingBirth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingBrick", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MassEmpoweringEvent", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified"]}
