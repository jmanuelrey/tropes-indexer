{"title": "Rightful King Returns", "content": "\n\u2022 Chronicles of the Kencyrath: In Torisen's backstory, he's definitely a bit of an Aragorn figure. Over a decade after his father renounced his titles and went into exile, Torisen arrived among his people, but passed as a relative of Lord Ardeth until he came of age, when he declared himself and took up his hereditary position. He's been Highlord for about three years or so when we first meet him. Deconstructed a little\u2014Torisen talks about how at first, the lords all liked the idea him being Highlord, after 31 years without one, but quickly became disillusioned, because 100% Adoration Rating is impossible. Torisen: When they acknowledged my claim three years ago, they said they wanted a leader, an impartial judge, but every one of them\u2014yes, even Ardeth\u2014thought that justice meant having things his own way. Now Caineron will promise them everything, or seem to. What's the alternative? A mad lord from a mad line who has only kept the peace and satisfied no one.\n\u2022 Enchanted Forest Chronicles: Talking to Dragons ends with the return of the rightful king (who'd been magically imprisoned), queen (who'd gone into hiding to raise their son and keep him safe from the would-be usurpers), and prince (who was the only one who could free his father from his prison, and literally only figured out who he and his parents really were about the second he achieved said freeing).\n\u2022 Land of Oz: Princess Ozma, the true ruler of Oz, is restored to her throne some time after Dorothy's original adventure; by the time Dorothy returns to Oz in the third book in the series, Ozma's back on her throne and ruling wisely and peacefully. Although the second book in the series details Ozma's recovery , Baum changed her origin story no less than three times during the writing of the rest of the series. Note that Ozma rules as anointed sovereign, but usually is not addressed as Queen; you know why. However, at the end of The Land of Oz, Ozma is referred to as a \"Queen\".\n\u2022 In G. K. Chesterton's The Paradoxes of Mr. Pond, a Royalist claimant might bring about this because of the problems with republics. \"Politicians do not understand much; but politicians do understand politics,\" said Pond pensively. \"I mean they do understand the IMMEDIATE effect on mobs and movements. Somehow he had slipped in and started a campaign of private popularity before they even knew who he was. When once he was popular, they were helpless. How could they say: 'Yes, he is popular, he is on the side of the people and the poor; the young men accept his leadership; but he is the King and therefore he must go'? They know how horribly near the world is to answering: 'Yes; he is the King and, by God, he shall stay.'\"\n\u2022 Subverted in Ranger's Apprentice. When , who is the rightful inheritor of the throne of Clonmel, returns to his kingdom, it is only to convince the king to stand up against an evil cult which threatens the kingdom. When it becomes clear that the king is in no way interested in helping his people, Halt briefly impersonates the king rather than deposing him, even though he had enough local support, as well as the right, to have carried it off.\n\u2022 Tortall Universe: Played with in the Trickster's Duet. The plot is about The Prophecy that the raka of the Copper Isles will be freed from their white luarin oppressors when a queen descended from the raka and luarin royal lines, but it's a part of a big power game between the Trickster God and his siblings, a lot of spycraft is involved on the mortal end, there are two candidates, and the one everyone wants is also the one they think won't be any good as queen. And then she runs away and her younger sister steps up, but she's a good queen mainly from becoming thoughtful, subtle, and intelligent from being in her sister's shadow.\n\u2022 In The Wheel of Time, this is the basis of the justification of the Seanchan's expansionist policy towards the Westlands: they are Arthur Hawkwing's legitimate heirs, and since Hawkwing's rule over the Westlands predate those of all of the current kings and queens, they are the rightful rulers of the place. Rand later throws back this argument to them in a quite hilarous way by pointing that since he is the reincarnation of Lews Therin, whose rule predates Hawkwing's by several centuries, he is the legitimate ruler of both the Seanchan and the Westlands.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightfulKingReturns?from=Main.RightfulQueenReturns", "media_links":
