{"title": "Prohibited Hero Saves the Day", "content": "Sometimes they're too young and inexperienced. Sometimes they're too reckless. Sometimes they made the wrong friends and the wrong enemies. Or perhaps they are just the \"wrong\" sex. But for whatever reason, the potential hero is prohibited from joining the others on their quest to destroy the Big Bad.\n\nOf course, the official heroes are inevitably captured and awaits their fate, their plans of saving the world dashed to smithereens. Who could possibly save them now? Aha, the Prohibited Hero has decided to snub the authorities (or employ Exact Words) and come along anyway, often becoming The Cavalry. It's a good thing too, because not only does he rescue the regular heroes, he usually manages to simultaneously foil the Big Bad's Evil Plan. If only the authorities had had some faith in him in the first place.\n\nThose prone to Fridge Logic may wonder if the delayed arrival of the Prohibited Hero contributed to her success. It's possible that had she gone with the others, she would have been captured along with them. It may be that part of her success is that she was the Wild Card the Big Bad was not expecting.\n\nCompare Changed My Mind, Kid when it's the Hero who made the decision not to come along, then relents.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProhibitedHeroSavesTheDay", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Simoun", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MyHeroAcademia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/SecretInvasion", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/YoungAvengers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheIncredibles", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Balto", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PacificRim", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PoliceAcademy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BeverlyHillsCop", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackTheBlock", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EndersGame", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLordOfTheRings", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Overwatch", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JackieChanAdventures", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JonnyQuest", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAdventuresOfSuperMarioBros3"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdventureRebuff", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCavalry", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveBureaucrat", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WildCard", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChangedMyMindKid", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheSquad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirborneAircraftCarrier", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/AdviceAndTrust", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMothership", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TagalongKid", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillItWithFire", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayInTheKitchen", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetPollyOliver", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoManOfWomanBorn", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonActionGuy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLoad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactWords", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LabRat", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LittleStowaway", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpider", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwillingSuspension"]}
