It could be because they grew up in a poor household and their family couldn't afford to throw one. It could be because they had a Friendless Background growing up, and nobody would come if a party was held for them. It could even be that they just hate the idea of having a birthday party. While they may go to other peoples' parties, or celebrate their own birthday with close family and friends, they've never had the experience of hearing a bunch of people yell \"SURPRISE!\" and celebrating the day they were born with a big party just for them. When this is found out, the person's friends/family will often try to right this wrong by giving them a birthday party for the first time.\n\nIn some extreme cases, the reason the person never had a birthday party... is because they never had a birthday! In other words, the character had no idea what day they were born, either due to a lack of proper birth records, or due to their culture not celebrating birthdays. Or perhaps they were simply never technically born. When this happens, other characters try to rectify the situation by finding out the person's birthday (or giving them an arbitrary day to celebrate it), and follow this up with giving them their first birthday party.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeverHadABirthdayParty", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChuckECheese", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KemonoJihen", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AIArtificialIntelligence", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotter", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LoskutikAndTheCloud", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MarriedWithChildren", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpaceCases", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/StevieWonder", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Disgaea5AllianceOfVengeance", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DisgaeaHourOfDarkness", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Goblins", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BrandyAndMrWhiskers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiloMurphysLaw", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TeenTitansGo", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheTransformers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS1E13SoManyBirthdays", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FriendlessBackground", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BirthdayHater", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseParty", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesntKnowTheirOwnBirthday", "https://www.businessinsider.com/chuck-e-cheese-backstory-origin-2017-6", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappyBirthdayToYou", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MartinLutherKingJr", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SnakePeople", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticRacism", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RichBitch", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsAllAboutMe", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS4E6BenderShouldNotBeAllowedOnTelevision", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialFamilyMember", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheJinx", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseParty", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThePerfectionist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS1E13SoManyBirthdays", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallySevenHundredYearsOld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeDissonance", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ServantRace", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AgainstMyReligion"]}
