{"title": "Over 100% Completion", "content": "Great! Looks like I can finally put the game dow...Wait, what do you mean there's a reward for doing it on all three files?!\n\nWhen 100% Completion and Rank Inflation collide. There are a number of video games that track the player's completion percentage, and in some of these games it's possible to go beyond 100%. This could be for a number of reasons:\n\u2022 The creators did it to hide secret content\n\u2022 The original game went to 100%, but later they added new content and upped the top percentage to match.\n\u2022 100% designates that you've done enough in the dev team's eyes, and they don't want to pressure most gamers into completing the insanely-hard challenges that the true top percentage would require (though in this case, actually tying it to the completion percentage makes this effort a bit self-defeating.)\n\u2022 It's just the game being cheeky about tracking completion\n\u2022 Some combination of the above\n\nMay be a consequence of a Fractional Winning Condition, where the game tells you you've obtained 100% of the necessary stuff when there is, in fact, more of it to collect.\n\u2022 Batman: Arkham Knight has a New Game plus mode that pushes the game to 200%. With the addition of the Season Of Infamy DLC it adds an additional 20% to the campaign meaning fully completing Arkham Knight with New Game Plus gets you 240%.\n\u2022 While the game doesn't normally track completion percentage, The Binding of Isaac Afterbirth gets extra cheeky about the concept by awarding your save file with a 1001% for unlocking and collecting everything. This goes even further in Afterbirth+ with 1,000,000%. Getting 1,000,000% in all three save files causes the game to register 3,000,000% completion.\n\u2022 Almost literally taken Up to Eleven in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, where it's possible to achieve 1100% completion in multiplayer due to the Prestige System.\n\u2022 Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin goes up to 1000% map completion \u2014 it has 10 sub-maps (including the main castle) each of which contributes 100% completion.\n\u2022 Castlevania: Symphony of the Night can reach 200.6% map completion due to a combination of hidden rooms and the existence of the Inverted Castle. However, it's also possible to exploit glitches to bring this percentage as high as 240%.\n\u2022 Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped goes to 105%, and Crash Bash reaches 200%.\n\u2022 A recurring trope in the Donkey Kong Country series. The first game tops out at 101%, the second at 102%, and the third at 105% (which is only possible by using a cheat code.) Donkey Kong 64 returns to 101%, only for DK: King of Swing, Donkey Kong Country Returns and Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze to go all the way to 200%.\n\u2022 id Software's Doom can tabulate a kill percentage above 100% on any level with an archvile in it, since archviles can resurrect dead monsters, except other archviles. A player routinely has to down the same enemy multiple times before concentrating fire upon the archvile itself, which raises the kill count above the installed enemy count.\n\u2022 Fez goes to an oddly specific 209.4%\n\u2022 Inverted with the first print of Gran Turismo 2 discs, in which it was only possible to achieve 98.2% completion.\n\u2022 Likewise with Just Cause 2, where it's only possible to achieve 99.67% completion due to several missing assets.\n\u2022 Hollow Knight originally stopped at 100%, then went up to 106% and later 112% with the addition of new goals from the DLC packages. This makes the \"100% in 20 hours\" and \"100% in Steel Soul Mode\" achievements much easier to get, as you can choose which 12% to omit; in particular, the Trial of the Fool and White Palace are no longer required.\n\u2022 Khimera: Destroy All Monster Girls: It's possible to collect over 100% of the reported money in a stage, because that's actually just how much money it takes to get A rank, and there's more money than that in a stage.\n\u2022 In Psychonauts beating every round of the punching minigame in Basic Braining awards a PSI Cadet rank, making it possible to have a rank of 101 over the supposed maximum of 100. Doing this in the Steam version nets you the achievement \"Math Is Hard\".\n\u2022 In SEUM Speedrunners From Hell, completing all secret levels will result in a completion of 666%.\n\u2022 Splatoon 2 has the Hero Mode campaign reach 1000% completion if you beat every stage and boss battle with all nine hero weapons. Though you'd only know that the game considers this to be 1000% if you use the SplatNet2 phone companion app, which tracks a bevy of player statistics. Strangely enough, the game doesn't do this with the Octo Expansion campaign.\n\u2022 Completing the Super Bonus Round level in Spyro: Year of the Dragon awards you 117% completion.\n\u2022 Super Bomberman 5 goes up to 200%\n\u2022 In maimai, the Achievement rating appears to be a percentage of the maximum score for the song, with 100% meaning you got an All Perfect. However, most charts have \"Break\" notes that award bonus points, 100% Achievement is based out of getting all Perfects and 2500 points on each Break note, and you can get 2550 or 2600 points on a Break if you hit it extra-accurately. In practice, the vast majority of All Perfect performances have something like 101.44% or even as high as 105%, depending on the ratio of Break notes to other notes, and furthermore it's possible to get 100% or more without getting all Perfects if you get a lot of 2550- and 2600-point Breaks.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Over100PercentCompletion", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BatmanArkhamKnight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheBindingOfIsaac", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BurnoutParadise", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CallOfDutyModernWarfare2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaPortraitOfRuin", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CastlevaniaSymphonyOfTheNight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBandicoot3Warped", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrashBash", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry1", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry2DiddysKongQuest", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountry3DixieKongsDoubleTrouble", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKong64", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DKKingOfSwing", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryReturns", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DonkeyKongCountryTropicalFreeze", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IdSoftware", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Doom", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fez", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GranTurismo", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JustCause2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HollowKnight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KhimeraDestroyAllMonsterGirls", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Psychonauts", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/RetroAchievements", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Splatoon2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SpyroYearOfTheDragon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperBomberman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Maimai"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneHundredPercentCompletion", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RankInflation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FractionalWinningCondition", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlatformHell", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Steam", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NumberOfTheBeast", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretLevel"]}
