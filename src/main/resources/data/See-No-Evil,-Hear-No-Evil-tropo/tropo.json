{"title": "See No Evil, Hear No Evil", "content": "In TV and movies, when we're not supposed to see something yet, we can't hear it either, regardless of how little sense that makes. Cars will not be audible until they come unexpectedly screeching around the corner or over the hill or out of the alley, people will turn up without having made any footsteps, an animal will not start its low growling until it's in shot. Sometimes when the reveal is being made by a camera pan, the sound will fade in as the subject becomes visible, as though the sound was being made the whole time, it's just we weren't at the right angle to hear it before.\n\nThis is often justified by the protagonists' attention being somewhere else, so that they (and by extension, the audience) don't hear what otherwise would be perfectly obvious, until it's right on top of them. It's only justifiable up to a point, though.\n\nSee also Surprise Vehicle, Stealth Hi/Bye, Behind the Black. Related to the Rule of Perception. Often overlaps with Enemy Rising Behind, Right Behind Me, and The End... Or Is It?. Compare and contrast It's Quiet... Too Quiet, Nothing Is Scarier, and Paranoia Fuel. The total inverse is Hell Is That Noise, when you hear something bad but can't see it.\n\nNot to be confused with the Monkey Morality Pose.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SeeNoEvilHearNoEvil", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Akira", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/FateStayNight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/JurassicPark", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AVPAlienVsPredator", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarWars", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AttackOfTheClones", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Cloverfield", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDayAfterTomorrow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRings", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FinalDestination", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hellboy2004", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLongKissGoodnight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TerminatorSalvation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Goldeneye", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLongestDay", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/WorldOfWarcraft", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DeadSpace", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TriOfFriendshipAndMadness", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents"], "non_media_links": ["http://www.toastyfrog.com/toastywiki/index.php/Site/ThumbnailTheatre", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseVehicle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SurpriseVehicle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StealthHiBye", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BehindTheBlack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfPerception", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyRisingBehind", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightBehindMe", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEndOrIsIt", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsQuietTooQuiet", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NothingIsScarier", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParanoiaFuel", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellIsThatNoise", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MonkeyMoralityPose", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NintendoEntertainmentSystem", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeDifficulty", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExpansionPack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FailedASpotCheck", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MusicalSpoiler"]}
