{"title": "Heroic Team Revolt", "content": "Some heroes aren't shining paragons of virtue. Frankly, some heroes aren't fit to bear the title of Anti-Hero. And sometimes, just sometimes, the rest of the squad notices this... and act accordingly.\n\nThere's no What the Hell, Hero? this time for the unfortunate bungler. Usually after a colossal screw up or a moment of incredible selfishness, the hero has completely alienated the rest of the team and they're leaving with disgust, if not actually out for their former leader's blood. If lucky they will merely be forcibly demoting the former leader. This rarely leads to a dead hero, but it often leads to the hero being on his own for a while while he gets his act together.\n\u2022 The hero may have a chance to redeem himself, and usually the rest of the squad is beleaguered while the hero learns his lesson and joins in with new skills and determination sorely needed, becoming the team's needed leader once again.\n\u2022 Alternatively, the hero and his lancer or other capable member may change positions. (Expect this one to cause trouble later.)\n\u2022 The hero may find himself Jumping Off the Slippery Slope as a Fallen Hero. This will also cause trouble as he's often one of the strongest characters, especially if his team abandoned him on moral grounds, and this kind of split is almost always on moral grounds as grounds of competence would simply lead to demotion.\n\u2022 If there were people who still agree with the current hero, there may be a case of Divided We Fall as the heroes turn on one another.\n\u2022 Rarely, it turns out that the companions are becoming more morally ambiguous or even outright evil while The Hero is still morally upright. The companions disagree with The Hero's dog petting, refusal to Shoot the Dog, and their general policy of Honor Before Reason. Depending on the tone of the story, the companions are either brought around, manage to corrupt the hero too, or force The Hero to find new True Companions.\n\u2022 Sometimes (oftentimes, if you're cynical), it turns out that it was the True Companions who are in the wrong, not The Hero. The author actually does want you to stay on the hero's side and complaints from the rest of the team are painted as bad cases of Poor Communication Kills, Honor Before Reason, or even The Complainer Is Always Wrong. If this is the case The Hero will usually bring the rest of the team around after getting a chance to explain himself.\n\u2022 Finally, on very rare occasions the hero and his team may split off entirely, the former hero eventually joining up with another heroic, neutral or evil group while the rest continue on.\n\nContrast Divided We Fall, where dissension arises despite the hero being in the right. Sub-trope of We ARE Struggling Together, which covers general good guy division.\n\nThe reasons for using this trope are numerous; it provides a moment of introspection for the hero and audience for the hero to really come to grips with his or her ideals and true feelings... and how far the hero has fallen away from them. And, perhaps, how that selfishness in putting the heroes own feelings above the needs of the group has led him away from cherished ideals... which the character finds he or she feels even more strongly about than the issues he or she was having before.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicTeamRevolt", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/FantasticFour", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsonsMovie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/CaptainBlood", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeOrigins", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BaldursGate", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/JadeEmpire", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TalesOfTheAbyss", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanumOfSteamworksAndMagickObscura", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/OregonTrail", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoredCore", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/MagicalDiary", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ShinMegamiTenseiIVApocalypse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/TheOrderOfTheStick", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllLovingHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightInShiningArmour", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicComedicSociopath", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ByronicHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeUltimateHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHeroToHisValet", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingOffTheSlipperySlope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedWeFall", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PetTheDog", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheDog", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WriterOnBoard", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrueCompanions", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonorBeforeReason", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComplainerIsAlwaysWrong", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DividedWeFall", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAREStrugglingTogether", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tearjerker", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MacGuffin", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cult", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Stoic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/OgreBattle64", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecameTheirOwnAntithesis", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcePilot", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrepareToDie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MyGodWhatHaveIDone", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DaddyHadAGoodReasonForAbandoningYou", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObliviousGuiltSlinging", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheLancer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperheroEpisode", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TokenEvilTeammate", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItAmusedMe", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfServingMemory"]}
