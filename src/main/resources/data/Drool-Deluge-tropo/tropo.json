{"title": "Drool Deluge", "content": "Cartoons enjoy exaggeration. Instead of just turning slightly pink, characters who blush go cherry red. Instead of just running really fast, characters who sprint leave a huge cloud of dust behind them. Instead of teardrops, characters literally cry a river of tears with the occasional booger bubbles. Instead of just leaking some saliva, characters who see a really tasty meal (or something else appealing) turn into living low-pressure fountains.\n\nA Droolugenote portmanteau of \"drool\" and \"deluge\" is when more drool than should actually be possible pours out of something's or someone's mouth. This can range from, say, making a visible puddle below, to covering the entire building with a hip-deep flood. Of course, this isn't just limited to cartoons, but that's where it's seen the most often.\n\nUsually Played for Laughs, but might be intended to cause Squick.\n\nCompare *Drool* Hello, where something above the characters signals its presence with a drip of drool, and Phlegmings, where a character's mouth has lines of drool to be gross or scary, Waterfall Puke, where characters leave a pool of vomit, and Ocular Gushers, the ocular equivalent.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroolDeluge", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/HappyHeroes", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TurnerAndHooch", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TomHanks", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NedsDeclassifiedSchoolSurvivalGuide", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Shantae", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TinyToonAdventures"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Headscratchers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaterIsAir", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighPressureEmotion", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WheelOFeet", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OcularGushers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InelegantBlubbering", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Squick", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DroolHello", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Phlegmings", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaterfallPuke", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OcularGushers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/PoochCafe", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/KevinAndKell"]}
