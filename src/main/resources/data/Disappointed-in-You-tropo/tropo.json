{"title": "Disappointed in You", "content": "With immeasurable sadness in her eyes, she said, \"I just want you to know... I'm not angry, Soi Fon. I'm disappointed.\" \n\nSoi Fon recoiled as if physically struck. \"Wh-what... what was...\" She muttered. What had just happened? Unohana had done nothing of note; she'd spoken a few words. They weren't even kido. And yet Soi Fon felt as though a spear of ice had been driven deep into her soul, a deep, crushing chill that permeated her entire being. \n\n\"I've done so much for you. I work tirelessly, day in and day out, to keep you and your little friends healthy and happy.\" Unohana said, still sadly. \"I do this because I care, Soi, I really do. And to see you respond by treating me like this... it hurts.\" \n\nSoi Fon fell to her knees. \"S... stop it...\" She muttered. \"What are you... what are you doing to... to me...\" \n\n\"Look me in the eyes when I talk to you, young lady.\" Unohana said firmly. \"I want you to understand just how much your selfishness has hurt the people who care about you.\" \n\n\"Oh... oh God...\" Soi Fon said weakly, tears in her eyes. What was going on? What was this woman doing to her? She hadn't been so much as scratched, but she felt so weak and terrible and... guilty.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisappointedInYou", "media_links": [], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/UninvitedGuests", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom"]}
