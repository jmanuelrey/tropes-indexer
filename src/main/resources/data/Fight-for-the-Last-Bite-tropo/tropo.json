{"title": "Fight for the Last Bite", "content": "Only \"Me\" When It Comes To Meat!\n\nTwo or more characters are enjoying a snack from a communal source. At some point there is a realization that there is only one left for multiple people. Hilarity ensues as this one bit of food, unlike its fallen brethren, becomes monumentally important. Usually, this is because the food was not divided evenly, such as there being 9 pizza slices for 4 people.\n\nThere are several variations on how this may play out:\n\nOne character may absent-mindedly reach for the last one, when they are interrupted to point out that it is the last one. This may be played for comedy as everyone realizes how important the last one is, or played for drama, likely resulting in an argument over why it's so important.\n\nIf multiple characters realize it at the same time, there may be a Wild West-style stare-down to share this understanding, followed by a quick-draw analogue in grabbing the last one, or a more convoluted competition to determine who is deserving. Cutting the last one in half and sharing it is NOT an option. Expect some Fork Fencing along the way, considering how likely this is to devolve into an actual, physical fight.\n\nOccasionally, one character may simply be deprived of the last one because they were absent when it was taken. They will very likely be upset by this and, sometimes, will launch an investigation to see who took it. If the food was something they themselves brought, they'll be especially angry.\n\nIf the \"last one\" is a MacGuffin, it's a Macguffin Melee. Subtrope of Lost Food Grievance.
