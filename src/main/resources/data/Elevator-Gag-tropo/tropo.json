{"title": "Elevator Gag", "content": "Most often seen in Warner Brothers Looney Tunes productions, this is any of several often surreal comedic bits surrounding the use of elevators in cartoons.\n\nIn the simplest variety, an improbable location (like a hole in the side of a shallow ravine) will suddenly manifest an elevator under the control of a Trickster character, complete with doors, call buttons beside them, and a floor indicator above the opening. The Trickster will then use the elevator, often \"ascending\" to an upper level that obviously doesn't exist.\n\nThe next variety uses a real elevator; the trickster acts as an old-style elevator operator in a department store and announces any variety of improbable items for each floor, often deceiving a villain into launching himself out of the elevator and into some unpleasant location.\n\nSlightly more aggressive is the acceleration of the elevator at improbable speeds by the Trickster operator, leaving the villain flattened against the floor or ceiling. Sufficiently fierce acceleration will render the villain a blob or coinlike disk, from which form he must exert himself to recover.\n\nElevators may also pass or open onto unlikely settings, including ones that may well be inhospitable to careless or villainous characters.\n\nLess common are elevator races or chases between Trickster and villain, running from ground floor to roof.\n\nBecause of the style of many elevators in the period when this trope evolved, they are usually depicted as having frosted glass windows in their doors, behind which a moving elevator is indicated as a band of light moving up or down. Elevator travel may also be indicated on the outside of buildings by the movement of lit windows; sometimes, like Star Trek turbolifts, they go sideways to get around the \"stepping\" in the sides of a skyscraper.\n\nElevators sometimes have clockface-style indicators above the doors with an arrow that points at the number which correspond to the floor the elevator is currently on. In comedies, it is possible to control elevators by manipulating these indicators \u2014 pulling the arrow to move the elevator car, or, alternately, trapping the elevator on or between floors by blocking the arrow.\n\nFor a much darker variation, see Hellevator.\n\nNot to be confused with other common gags involving elevators, such as Uncomfortable Elevator Moment, The Elevator from Ipanema, and Elevator Floor Announcement.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElevatorGag", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyMouseAndDuckComics", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheThreeStooges", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LaurelAndHardy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheGreatGlassElevator", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PercyJacksonandTheOlympians", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PoliceSquad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HalfLife2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SilentHill", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/JurassicPark", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Scratch", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Xkcd", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DanAndMabsFurryAdventures", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BuccaneerBunny", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DonaldDuck", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PorkyInWackyland", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FilmationsGhostbusters", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockyAndBullwinkle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePerilsOfPenelopePitstop", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WileECoyoteAndTheRoadrunner", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLooneyTunesShow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFoxAndTheCrow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DangerMouse"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTrickster", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElevatorFloorAnnouncement", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquashedFlat", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hellevator", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElevatorTropes", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UncomfortableElevatorMoment", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheElevatorFromIpanema", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElevatorFloorAnnouncement", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KitschyLocalCommercial", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag", "https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/2118693/", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IFellForHours", "http://xkcd.com/288/", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZeppelinsFromAnotherWorld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClapYourHandsIfYouBelieve", "http://www.missmab.com/Comics/Vol_806.php", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElevatorFloorAnnouncement", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedHeadquarters", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence"]}
