{"title": "Only in It for the Money", "content": "\n\u2022 In Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War, Cipher and Pixy initially fight in the eponymous conflict for Ustio's money, as Pixy regularly reminds us on the radio. In fact, many regular forces comment on this in disdain... until both of them are so feared/revered for their accomplishments that nobody mentions it anymore (especially if you take the Knight route). The fact that Pixy goes MIA and is replaced with PJ, who is a commissioned Ustio officer, as your wingman probably contributes.\n\u2022 Many minor characters in Armored Core series is explicitly described as purely in it for the money. Since Ravens are, after all, mercenaries (or, as one of the Bureau said it, \"Dispute Resolution Agents\"), fighting purely for the filthy lucre isn't all that unjustified. People who do espouse this kind of view run the gamut from being simply in love with cash, greedy bastard(s) who couldn't care less about others, recently unemployed ex-blue-collar worker that needs to desperately earn a living, a notoriously spendthrifty person who uses only Energy weapons due to them not having an ammo cost, all the way to a Hitman with a Heart. This tradition is continued all the way to Armored Core: Verdict Day, where the player character is yet another mercenary eking out a living amidst the war between the Three Great Forces.\n\u2022 Subverted with Wynne D. Fanchon, and otherwise the majority of LYNXes in Armored Core 4/for Answer. Being one step above the rank-and-file soldiers that use MT or Normals, some of them truly takes the Honor Before Reason approach a bit far. Wynne D. Fanchon: \"Of course. Otherwise, aren't we simply in the business of killing?\"\n\u2022 Also subverted with Rosary in Armored Core V. Although she started out this way, she genuinely grew to be fond of her latest clients: Fran, the daughter of a late revolutionary, and you, the player character.\n\u2022 Then double subverted in the ending of the Order Missions, where, when asked what to do by \"living for one's own sake\", she immediately suggests making money as the first thing to do.\n\u2022 Of the 8 assassins hired by Black Mask in Batman: Arkham Origins, only Deathstroke, Copperhead, Electrocutioner, and Deadshot care about the money. This is especially true with Deathstroke. When it's revealed that The Joker is the true mastermind ( For the Evulz naturally) and there is no money involved anymore, he simply stays in his cell and refuses to get involved. Annoyed, he even says that he never would have taken the job had he known there would be no money.\n\u2022 In Batman: Arkham Knight, comes back again, and explains the reason he didn't come back earlier is that it took this long for someone to be willing/able to pay enough to be worth his time. He also says that he took payment in advance, making him \"contractually obliged\" to finish the job. After losing again, he declares now It's Personal and he'll kill Batman for free .\n\u2022 Bendy and the Ink Machine: Wally Franks is always threatening to quit his janitorial job at Joey Drew Studios, but he stays on as work conditions get progressively worse. The only thing that keeps him motivated to keep the job is the money. Considering that the studio was in business primarily through the Great Depression, it's likely that he's the variety that just needs to make a living. Wally: Also, get this, Joey had each of us donate something from our work station. We put them on these little pedastals in the break room. To help appease the gods, Joey says. Keep things going. I think he's lost his mind, but hey, he writes the checks.\n\u2022 Wilhelm in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel! is purely mercenary and has basically no goals in life other than \"make a lot of money\" and \"apply more cybernetics\". Everyone gets a recorded ECHO log explaining why they're going to Elpis to hunt a Vault; Wilhelm's is the most direct: Recording!Jack: Hey Wilhelm, wanna come to the moon and hunt a Vault for me? \n\nRecording!Wilhelm: No. \n\nRecording!Jack: I'll pay you a couple million dollars. \n\nRecording!Wilhelm: Okay. \n\n[End Recording] \n\nWilhelm: Yep. That's my backstory.\n\u2022 Disgaea 4: New angel Vulcanus is in it only for the Zenons. She's called the Angel of Avarice for a reason. Hard to say if it's to fuel the Great Flonnger or not...\n\u2022 This applies to just about every playable character in the Jagged Alliance series to a greater or lesser extent, as well as quite a few of the non-Mook enemies. Taken Up to Eleven by \"Mike\", the top-tier (and top price Most mercenaries demand a few hundred to a few thousand dollars a day, with the second most expensive mercenary starting at $5,500 a day. Mike starts at $12,000 a day, which would get you a full team of qualified mercenaries easily ) mercenary from the first game; in-game flavour text from the sequel states that he's parted ways with the Association of International Mercenaries because they were tired of his ridiculous salary demands. Not altogether surprisingly, he turns up working for the other side.\n\u2022 The Vailian Trading Company in Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire, which actually helps their case when compared to Rautai. They don't want to trample the Huana culture like the Ruataians do, they just want to do business. And while they're a morally grey bunch, many of them even do so honestly. Though their willingness to overlook the slave trade is a bit of an issue, they can be convinced it's better to wipe the slavers out.\n\u2022 Lawrence the helmsman in Skies of Arcadia makes it clear that he doesn't give a damn about Vyse's goal, but he'll follow him to the ends of the earth as long as he's paid. Lawrence: If I had known how big this job was going to be, I would have asked for more than 10,000 gold...\n\u2022 In Sonic Adventure 2, Rouge the Bat appears to be this at first, going into action to get her hands on the Master Emerald, but she's actually a government spy trying find out what Dr. Eggman is up to. Although she still insists on getting paid for her services.\n\u2022 In Sonic Heroes, Team Chaotix is initially reluctant but is spurred into action when their client offers to \"pay them handsomely\"\u2014they are working for , and Vector knows it, but they are perpetually broke and desperately need the money. They ultimately manage to obtain two Chaos Emeralds and are the extra nudge Sonic needs to defeat the final boss. Eggman WAS going to pay them, but only after he had taken over the world. Vector has had enough of him and forcibly removes the money from his pockets. By that, he means getting revenge on Eggman for forgetting not to pay him.\n\u2022 In a subversion, Vector, according to his background, is willing to do anything for money, but he usually does it when there's good deeds involved and he also has a sense of justice as well.\n\u2022 Dex from the webgame Strike Force Heroes 2 is the only member of the title team who isn't in it for the cause. He turns out to be the one tipping off their enemies, the evil organization Globex, for cash. He kills West, the General of the team, and Professor Iagi, whose research the team was counting on against Globex's clones, but is ultimately killed by the Globex Leader, who considered him a great pawn, but too expensive to keep around .", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlyinitForTheMoney", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AceCombatZeroTheBelkanWar",
