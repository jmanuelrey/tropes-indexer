{"title": "Horror Struck", "content": "A character has been called to a small town to investigate some supernatural phenomenon. Our intrepid hero subscribes more to logic than superstition, though, and he is confident that the disturbance will prove to have mundane origins. The locals tell him tales of this horrible monster, and he laughs them off as the products of an overactive imagination. With this knowledge under his belt, he bravely sets out to catch the miscreant.\n\nThis ends when he actually SEES the monster \u2014 and finds that it is just as advertised, and worse. He sees the eerie, glowing intelligence in its eyes, smells the rotten meat on its breath, gets smacked around a bit, but survives, running back to safety to hide under the bed and refusing to come out because it's real it's real OH MY GOD IT'S REAL... even though that's what everyone's been telling him up till now.\n\nInspired by the protagonist of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and in particular Ichabod Crane's portrayal in Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow, this state is what results when mundane presuppositions come crashing against the supernatural reality, and the character in question just can't handle it.\n\nDiffers from Heroic BSoD in that this is not necessarily a result of emotional trauma.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HorrorStruck", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLegendOfSleepyHollow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheLegendOfSleepyHollow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SleepyHollow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SleepyHollow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlairWitchProject", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheMothmanProphecies", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBrothersGrimm", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyNameIsBruce", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GraveEncounters", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GhostHunters", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheWolfman2010", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheNightFlier", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FourteenOhEight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/StephenKing", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FourteenOhEight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/HPLovecraft", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamlet", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Nethergate", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ResidentEvil7Biohazard", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheSlenderManMythos", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/ScoobyDoo", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBlairWitchProject"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoingNative", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypticLog", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SupernaturalProofFather", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkepticNoLonger", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fainting", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Discworld/Pyramids", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WrongGenreSavvy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Blog/SeekingTruth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/EverymanHYBRID", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCGGlQ_vKms"]}
