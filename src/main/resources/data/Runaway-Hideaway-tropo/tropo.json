{"title": "Runaway Hideaway", "content": "A Runaway Hideaway is a place The Runaway character can call home (either temporarily or permanently).\n\nThe form it takes will vary wildly depending on the story's genre, setting, and plot. It can range from an abandoned city to a campsite in the woods, though it doesn't necessarily need to be a desolate or abandoned landscape. Some runaways go to orphanages or the homes of trusted relatives (if they have any). It may even be a brothel or the home of a kind stranger. There are several main subtypes of this trope:\n\nIn Real Life this may not be the smartest course of action, as your guardians would presumably look for you here. However, if the relatives are upstanding, they might be able to help if the runaway is escaping abuse. (See Staying with Friends\n\nThe runaway runs to a local shelter or orphanage. Abused or not, this is usually a better option than Type 2.\n\nType 2 - No place to go\n\nAn especially na\u00efve character may run away from home and into the Big Scary World without having a plan. This type is the most likely to end up in a stranger's house, which can lead to a bad end if said stranger turn out to be a crazy pervert or Serial Killer.\n\nType 3 - Off to the Smoke\n\nThe runaway has heard rumors of a place where runaways of all shapes and sizes can take shelter, and decides this is the place to try their luck. If people are disappearing in the story, they may end up here. Characters may run here just for yuks, to see if the Urban Legend is true.\n\nOne weirdly common place for runaways to end up is the circus, possibly because the circus naturally lends itself to being made up of a Ragtag Bunch of Misfits. If it turns out to be a Circus of Fear, the runaway may be convinced to return home.\n\nType 5 - We can be spared (thank God)!\n\nWhether you're seeking religious freedom in a foreign country or you're the Last of Your Kind, this type is the place where you can live without bloodshed, worry or war! Ironically, these types are prone to getting invaded or involved in war no matter how many barriers they put up...\n\nMake a Runaway Hideaway can help you create your character's new home.\n\u2022 Arguably Kaede House in Elfen Lied. Mayu is an abused runaway, Lucy/Nyu is an orphan runaway, Nana is taken there by Mayu after Kurama let her escape. Fits Type 5 for multiple reasons.\n\u2022 Yoshitaka's house in He Is My Master.

The whole place ends up on fire and Dick helps rescue the kids that don't make it out on their own. The boy Dick was looking for that led him to discover the hideaway ends up adopted by a bartender who lives in the same building as him.\n\u2022 In Relative Heroes the four Weinberg kids and the youngest's babysister (who is fleeing from a marriage contract with an Olympian that her mom set up for her as an infant) travel across the country in their deceased parents' RV as they try to prevent their remaining family from being split up by social services and eventually are able to take refuge with their grandfather after Superman intervenes.\n\u2022 The apple barrel in the MLP:FiM fan fiction Our True Colors.\n\u2022 The Smoke in Uglies, for which Type 3 is named.\n\u2022 The Sanctuary in The Heir Chronicles fits type 5\u2014includes the barrier too!\n\u2022 The abandoned movie theater in The Thief Lord which a small group of street kids have made into their home.\n\u2022 Greentree in The Outlaws of Sherwood is a Type 3, much to the pragmatic Robin Hood's dismay.\n\u2022 The Shadow Children are looking for a Type 3 or 5 since their very existence is punishable by death.

Angel runs away from her husband three times: firstly, to a brothel; secondly, to a gold mining town where she finds works as a cook; and thirdly, to the same town where she sets up a ministry to help girls who were sold into prostitution and reintegrate them into society. This is important because it shows how her character has changed over the novel's course: at first, she's so broken she can't function in society, or learn how to be anything but self-destructive. The second time, she manages to be something better than an object for others' gratification, but she still isn't happy or making something of herself. The third and final time, she is able to harness the love shown her by her husband and reach out to others, and in such a way that it remains effective even after she returns home and is finally Happily Married.\n\u2022 Type 3: In Charby the Vampirate Leonard's \"pack\" of welves (cursed elves) are all runaways who had to or chose to leave their family's packs that all live in a cabin he found.

Timmy even mistakes it for a circus at first, which Cosmo says is wrong because \"Circuses have child labor laws\" while carnivals \"barely have to follow the laws of physics.\" Turns out kids using magic to run away is common enough that multiple other fairies made the carnival so the kids would have somewhere to go until they decided to return.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunAwayHideAway", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ElfenLied", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HeIsMyMaster", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InnocentsShounenJuujigun", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TheTaleOfOneBadRat", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Nightwing", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RelativeHeroes", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Superman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Uglies", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHeirChronicles", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThiefLord", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheOutlawsOfSherwood", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ShadowChildren", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBoxcarChildren", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/FromTheMixedUpFilesOfMrsBasilEFrankweiler", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MySideOfTheMountain", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AdventuresOfHuckleberryFinn", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/RedeemingLove", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CharbyTheVampirate", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddparents", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ChannelChasers"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRunaway", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisBedOfRoses", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StayingWithFriends", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKiller", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrbanLegend", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RagtagBunchOfMisfits", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CircusOfFear", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LastOfHisKind", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SoYouWantTo/MakeARunAwayHideAway", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeedsWikiMagicLove", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ComicBooks", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FanWorks", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OurTrueColors", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Literature", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappilyMarried", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Webcomics", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RebelLeader", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResitance"]}
