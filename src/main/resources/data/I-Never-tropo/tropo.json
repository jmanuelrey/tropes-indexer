{"title": "I Never", "content": "\"I Never...\" or \"Never Have I Ever...\" is a Drinking Game played frequently by college students.\n\nThe premise is simple: Everyone has a drink. Going around in a circle, players begin, \"I never...\" and finish the statement with an action or behavior. Everyone who has done so must drink.\n\nIn Real Life, this is a way for friends to get to know each other better, although it has a tendency to turn nasty, becoming spiteful and a way to embarrass \"friends.\" It is also probable that someone will be playing only to learn new gossip about the other players. They will probably react badly if called on this.\n\nIt is also sometimes known as \"ten fingers,\" because it can be played by putting down a finger instead of taking a drink, if you're in a setting where alcohol is unavailable. It gets raunchy.\n\nIn fiction, it's just mild teasing, and it's great for character exposition.\n\u2022 This Knights of the Old Republic fanfic.\n\u2022 This Lucky Star fanfic, using candy instead of alcohol.\n\u2022 Hetalia fanfic It's a Small World After All's sequel, It's Raining Women, has one here.\n\u2022 Shows up frequently in the MLP:FiM loops, mostly to allude to or reference NoodleIncidents involving loops we don't see. One memorable occasion involves Discord getting out of a turn by using a paradox: Discord: Never have I ever caused someone to drink in 'Never Have I Ever'. *Everyone reaches for their drinks before working it out.* Applejack: So, if'n we drink...That mean he's lyin', an' we don't drink? Twilight: New rule: paradoxical statements are not valid turns.\n\u2022 Played in the Miraculous Ladybug fic Porte-Boner during the party at Adrien's house, spanning multiple chapters. Probably the funniest part of the game is when Marinette unexpectedly gets the entire room to admit to having had at least one sexual fantasy involving an Akuma, much to her shock.\n\u2022 Taken to hilarious extremes in where, no matter what activity is named, at least one person has performed it.\n\u2022 In a group of Gryffindors and Slytherins plays it.\n\u2022 In Us Against the World most of the Gryffindor eighth-years play it.\n\u2022 Service With A Smile: In chapter 24, after the twins and Neo take Jaune and Pyrrha to the club's private room, they engage in a few rounds of this. We learn in short order that Jaune's been caught masturbating (he has seven sisters, he has no privacy), Miltia has publicly exposed herself (she got woken up for an emergency and stumbled out without putting her clothes on properly), Jaune has never made out with a girl (Miltia happily corrects that one), and Pyrrha has never made out with a boy (Pyrrha happily corrects that one using Jaune).\n\u2022 In Tim nearly passes out while playing it on his bachelor night because being bisexual means there isn't much that he hasn't done.\n\u2022 Appears (unsurprisingly) in Beerfest, where we find out that tough-guy Landfill made out with a (presumably male) coach at the local high school .\n\u2022 Appears in American Reunion, where Oz's girlfriend Mia admits to having had an orgy and sex in public, much to the dismay of Oz's ex Heather, who is also playing.\n\u2022 In The Boat That Rocked, the lesbian cook of the ship (the only woman on board) says, \"I've never had sex with a man.\" One crew member sheepishly swigs.\n\u2022 Features in Loving Annabelle. Annabelle uses it to come out.\n\u2022 At one point in Unfriended, the protagonists play this, but as Laura points out, \"the loser doesn't drink, the loser dies\".\n\u2022 Sawyer and Kate play \"I Never...\" on Lost. The scene establishes that each has killed a man and that Kate has been married.\n\u2022 On Brooklyn Nine-Nine, the girls try to play it at Amy's bachelorette party, but Amy ends up not drinking throughout the entire game.\n\u2022 \"I Never...\" was played on an episode of Medium where it became a clue that a man was possessed by his murderer ancestor. He was playing with his girlfriend and she asked whether he had dreamt of menstrual blood running down a virgin's leg and then slitting her throat. He had to take a drink.\n\u2022 There was one episode of Frasier wherein the characters played a version called \"I'm the Dullest Person\" during a blackout, using pennies. Roz: Well at least pick a game someone else has has a chance of winning.\n\u2022 We then find out that Roz has had sex in a phone booth, in an elevator, on a plane, and on a merry go round. Roz: I was in College, I was trying to find myself. \n\nNiles: Well maybe you should have checked underneat the nearest man.\n\u2022 An episode in the first season of Veronica Mars had flashbacks featuring the main character and her former friends ditching going to homecoming and drinking champagne in a limo while playing \"I Never.\"\n\u2022 Mentioned on an episode of How I Met Your Mother. Lily thinks the worst thing about having only had one sexual partner is not being able to play this game (not that she's inexperienced, she just doesn't want people to know all the weird stuff she lets Marshall do to her).\n\u2022 Played in a bar on Fastlane between Van Ray, Deaqon Hayes and Simone.\n\u2022 Used in The L Word episode \"Lifecycle.\" The question of whether anyone playing has ever cheated on anyone ends up causing a serious mess.\n\u2022 In the series finale of ER a girl shows up in an alcohol-induced coma after \"winning\" a game that was actually supervised by another girl's parents.\n\u2022 Done by the Greek ZBZ's (without drinking), and ends up with a fight between Casey and Frannie.\n\u2022 Discussed on Top Gear during a news segment, in which Clarkson notes that an easy turn for a guy is to say \"I've never used a tampon\". Hammond notes this for future reference, but May says he has used one (for \"you know, spillage\") then goes on with an innuendo-laden discussion of two legitimate uses a man might find for a tampon. Given that all three hosts did use tampons in the Bolivia special (to help seal their cars for a river crossing), this becomes Hilarious in Hindsight.\n\u2022 In Game of Thrones, Tyrion, Bronn, and Shae play a similar game where they ask each other questions about their pasts. Despite his confidence that he will win, Tyrion ends up revealing more than his companions.\n\u2022 The staff of Cloud Nine in Superstore play this game with each other after they get Locked in a Room.\n\u2022 On The Big Bang Theory episode \"The Big Bear Percipitaiton\", Leonard, Sheldon, Amy and Penny play \"Never have I ever...\" to pass the time at a cabin while it's raining outside. It leads to a spat between Leonard and Penny when it's revealed that Leonard keeps a secret money account. We also learned that Sheldon was arrested for jaywalking (or rather, for harassing an officer for not arresting him for jaywalking) and that Amy once pushed all the buttons on an elevator. (\"Everyone has a past.\")\n\u2022 In the 7 Y\u00fcz episode \"B\u00fcy\u00fck G\u00fcnahlar\", a game of \"never have I ever\" at a New Year's Eve party provides the frame through which Mete relates his story.\n\u2022 Happy Days: Fonzie is invited to a socialite's dinner party but only for the purpose of making fun of him. When Fonzie catches on, he leaves but not before he dresses down his hostess. She huffs \"Well, I never!\" To which the Fonz replies, \"Yeah, maybe that's your problem!\"\n\u2022 In The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Geralt, Eskel, and Lambert can engage in a round of \"I Never\" during their drunken night in. The \"I Never\"s are predictably saucy, including sleeping with a succubus and taking fisstech as one of Geralt's possible choices, to both of which Eskel drinks, prompting Lambert to quip that still waters run deep. If Geralt chooses the other possible dialogue option in the game, Lambert reveals himself as having slept with his best friend's wife.\n\u2022 The webcomic Bohemials (the sequel to Albion Fuzz) featured dialogue clearly from a game of I Never in the background of an early strip .\n\u2022 The Alt Text from this xkcd comic.\n\u2022 In an El Goonish Shive storyline in which Ellen and Nanase are among the few guests at a college party not drinking, there's a montage of scenes that drive them upstairs to play video games. One of them is some of the college kids playing I Never and lamenting that not enough of them have actually done things.\n\u2022 Another non-alcoholic version of \"I Never...\" occurs in the lonelygirl15 episode \"Backyard Bikini Patrol\". The point was obviously not to get drunk (they were playing with M&M's), but to learn \"something juicy\" about the participants. Served as a means of delivering exposition because we found out how different the lives of trait positives were from those of normal girls.\n\u2022 On Family Guy, the guys play this on a boating trip. Quagmire ends up taking a drink for everything the other characters think of, and eventually they're actively trying to come up with something he hasn't done, getting progressively more ridiculous (for some reason, it never occurs to them to say something non-sexual, nor is it ever shown to be Quagmire's turn to say \"I never\"). It doesn't work, and he ends up passing out. Peter: God, let's see, what else is there, um... I never gave a reach-around to a spider monkey while reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. \n\nQuagmire: Oh, God. \n\n(Quagmire takes a drink.)", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INever", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfTheOldRepublic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LuckyStar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AxisPowersHetalia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Highlander", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MiraculousLadybug", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Beerfest", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanPie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheBoatThatRocked", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LovingAnnabelle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Unfriended", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Lost", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BrooklynNineNine", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Medium", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Frasier", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Fastlane", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheLWord", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ER", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Greek", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TopGear", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Superstore", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBigBangTheory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/YediYuz", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HappyDays", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher3WildHunt", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Xkcd", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrinkingGame", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife", "http://kotorfanmedia.net/node/3158", "http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5029771/15/A_Cluster_of_Stars", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ItsASmallWorldAfterAll", "http://www.fanfiction.net/s/6955412/9/Its_Raining_Women", "http://www.fanfiction.net/s/5432365/1/Never-Ever", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheInfiniteLoops", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident", "https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2615234/1/I-Never", "http://archiveofourown.org/works/9501449/chapters/21582914", "https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10509651/1/Us-Against-The-World", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ServiceWithASmile", "https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12089693/32/The-Last-Straw", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForDrama", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadlyGame", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flashback", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NeatFreak", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilariousInHindsight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LockedInARoom", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PokeThePoodle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenDepths", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/INever", "http://www.hirezfox.com/jimrob/afbh/bohemials/bh01.html", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AltText", "http://xkcd.com/565/", "http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=1637", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Lonelygirl15", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfFunny", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey"]}
