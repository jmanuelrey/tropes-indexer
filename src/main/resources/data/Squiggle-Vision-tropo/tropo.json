{"title": "Squiggle Vision", "content": "Squigglevision is the name of a patented computer process by Tom Snyder, used to cut animation costs by creating the illusion of movement through exaggerated line boil. The psychological effect on the audience is similar to that of the Jittercam, similarly used in anime to create the illusion of movement while cutting down on the amount of drawings used in the animation. This short-lived 90s piece of software is sometimes used to describe all animation with exaggerated line boil, including a lot of animation that was done decades before Squigglevison was conceived (and even before its creator was conceived).\n\nThe program used to achieve Squigglevision was called Animator Pro. As this program had been around since 1991, it was virtually a requirement to switch gears to keep up with the times. As a result, starting with the second season of Home Movies, all future Soup2Nuts shows used Flash animation instead.\n\u2022 Hey Monie (first short only; switched to Flash soon after)\n\u2022 The first season of Home Movies (later seasons use non-squiggly Flash animation)\n\u2022 Science Court (which itself was later renamed Squigglevision and slightly reformatted)", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquiggleVision", "media_links": ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDickAndPaulaCelebritySpecial", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrKatzProfessionalTherapist", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HomeMovies", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScienceCourt"], "non_media_links": ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineBoil", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jittercam", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineBoil", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AdobeFlash", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation"]}
