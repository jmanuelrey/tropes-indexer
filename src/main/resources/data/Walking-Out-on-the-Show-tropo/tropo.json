{"title": "Walking Out on the Show", "content": "Sometimes a show isn't all it's cracked up to be. Sometimes it's too boring to stand, too stupid to stand, or it's just plain awful. Sometimes the subject matter isn't to your taste, or something happened during the show that has you wanting to bang your head against the nearest wall. Maybe the band's playing at that concert is just atrocious, or maybe that game is going so badly for your home team that it's no use watching them anymore. Whatever the case, sometimes the show is such that you can't sit through another minute of it and you're wanting back the money that you spent to see it. It's time to walk out.\n\nWalking out of a show is a universal sign that the production being viewed is of poor quality. This is usually a very extreme reaction, as the typical response to seeing a bad show is to just sit and wait it out, as sitting is usually easier than standing and walking, and people usually don't have any other place to go and paid too much money on tickets to not wait and see if the show improves. Walk-outs, thus, usually only occur when the show is so bad that it's painful or disturbing, especially if the walk-outs occur en masse. This was actually Invoked in Vaudeville to keep ticket sales up, as people expected to see as many acts as they wanted when they bought a ticket.\n\nIn media, walking out is often used to showcase a character's bad acting or other performing ability, or a bad performance in general (such as a poorly put-together School Play). Sometimes everyone walks out except for a few people (usually the protagonists) who truly, honestly enjoy the thing.\n\nWhen this happens in Real Life, it is very much an Audience Reaction (and thus no Real Life examples should be added).\n\nSee also Screw This, I'm Outta Here!", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkingOutOnTheShow", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/VeggieTales", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathBecomesHer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MerylStreep", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BruceWillis", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheProducers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheITCrowd", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SesameStreet", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ADollsHouse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthParkBiggerLongerAndUncut", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/CyndiLauper", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LooneyTunes", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BugsBunny", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFlintstones", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePinkPanther", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/HenryMancini", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ABugsLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/TheBandConcert", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanBeyond"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Invoked", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vaudeville", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolPlay", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AudienceReaction", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewThisImOuttaHere", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMusical", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SweetBirdOfYouth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dFYsrGw5eI", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/MrPlastimime", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS4E22KrustyGetsKancelled", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS4E18TheDevilsHandsAreIdlePlaythings", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MickeyMouse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/PhineasAndFerbLightsCandaceAction"]}
