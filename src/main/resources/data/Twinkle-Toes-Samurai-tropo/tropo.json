{"title": "Twinkle Toes Samurai", "content": "In some media, a katana-wielding swordsman will dash toward his opponent, taking dainty little steps akin to a Japanese schoolgirl. Typically, this does not diminish his speed in any way. Mickey Mousing sound effects optional.\n\nBased on actual kendo footwork, but exaggerated to the point of absurdity.\n\u2022 Kenshin and Soujiro in Rurouni Kenshin. Often, they move too fast to see, but their tiny little footsteps advancing at a slow pace are the only indication something is approaching.\n\u2022 Parodied with Sentarou Daimonji's grandmother in Ranma \u00bd. Despite not being a swordswoman, she always walks like this while dressed up in a kimono - if she ever walks at all. A whole episode had Sentarou and the lady's assistants freaking out at the possibility to have Lady Daimonji fully standing up, and naturally Hilarity Ensues.\n\u2022 Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishii in Kill Bill during the meeting of the bosses, immediately before beheading Boss Tanaka. Justified as she was wearing traditional Japanese clothing at the time: If she didn't take those dainty little steps, she'd probably end up with a face full of table.\n\u2022 The Hidden Blade goes as far as portraying that samurai are so locked on the short-stepped shuffling gait of swordfighting that they've forgotten how to run properly. A westernized scholar races a samurai to show the superiority of the \"western style\" of running, which is just normal running.\n\u2022 In Snow Crash, part of the way that Hiro reocgnizes that a swordfighting opponent in The Metaverse is a kendo practicioner is the way he shuffles around.\n\u2022 How every ninja but Earthquake runs in Samurai Shodown.\n\u2022 Soul Series: Taki does this for a couple of moves.\n\u2022 Though it's in his Ninja ability, Kirby does this when he runs over water.\n\u2022 Murakumo from Akatsuki Blitzkampf runs like this in the game, and it comes off as... needlessly hilarious.\n\u2022 Serph of Digital Devil Saga runs like this when in his Varna form, complete with Airplane Arms. It's only visible during Field Hunts.\n\u2022 Varna's feet are always in this position, so it's probably justified.\n\u2022 Scar evades Gaff's spinning attacks with this walk in Eon Kid.\n\u2022 Miyamoto Musashi denounces this type of footwork in his Book of Five Rings.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwinkleToesSamurai", "media_links": ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NinjaScroll", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KenAkamatsu", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RurouniKenshin", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/LucyLiu", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/KillBill", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHiddenBlade", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowCrash", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SamuraiShodown", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SoulSeries", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Kirby", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AkatsukiBlitzkampf", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DigitalDevilSaga", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/IronKid"], "non_media_links": ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MickeyMousing", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheVerse", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KimonoIsTraditional", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HilarityEnsues", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Film", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffWithHisHead", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustifiedTrope", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KimonoIsTraditional", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Literature", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMetaverse", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WalkOnWater", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AirplaneArms", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingIsBetterWithSpinning", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/MiyamotoMusashi"]}
