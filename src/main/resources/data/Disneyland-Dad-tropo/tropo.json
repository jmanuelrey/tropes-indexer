Front row.As usual, the best money can buy.\n\nA non-custodial or limited-custodial parent who tends to take their offspring somewhere spectacular and do expensive stuff to earn or show affection. Disneyland Dad doesn't spend time with his kids, so he spends money on them instead.\n\nWhen parents divorce, it's understood that one parent will move out of the family home. The parent that leaves generally will see a drastic reduction in how often they get to see their children, which may or may not be because of limited visitation rights. This trope can also apply to parents who were never married and have chosen to go their separate ways but still have children as a result of their relationship.\n\nGenerally, there are two types of Disneyland Dads:\n\u2022 Type I: Got the short end of the custodial stick, but genuinely loves their kids and wants to spend time with them despite the restrictions in their custodial arrangement. The physical distance from their kids is emotionally taxing for them, and when they do have their children, they want the experience to be as memorable as possible to make up for their inability to spend more time together. How to show the kids Dad loves them? Take them to the most magical place on Earth!\n\u2022 Type II: Doesn't get to see the kids often and that's fine. After all, they have a career or post-breakup personal life to focus on. However, even parents who are cool with not seeing their kids every day, or even every month, periodically get a paternal or maternal inkling and feel obligated to go pick up the kids for visit. But what to do with them? What are the kids even into nowadays? Don't know? Take 'em to Disneyland! What kid can resist Disneyland?!\n\nWhile the kids may love this or think it's incredibly lame, depending on age and disposition, the point of the outing is for the non-custodial parent and kids to be able to spend time together with minimal preparation, restrictions, or discipline, often allowing this parent to be seen as the \"fun parent.\"\n\nThis style of parenting can backfire, possibly resulting in a \"The Reason You Suck\" Speech by the primary custodial parent, who's tired of looking like the boring, bad guy for enforcing the rules on an everyday basis, or the offspring finally tiring of the elaborate but sporadic outings and making it clear that their affection can't be bought.\n\nMay overlap with \"Well Done, Dad!\" Guy, Visit by Divorced Dad, and Push Over Parents.
