{"title": "Language Drift", "content": "averts it: The Eldian people living behind the Walls on Paradis Island speak the same language without any noticeable difference as their kin in the mainland (enough so that a few individuals from outside can infiltrate without arousing any suspicion), despite being separated for over a century; this trope is also touched upon when Zeke Yeager as the Beast Titan attempts to communicate with Mike and Zeke briefly wonders if they are still speaking the same language when he gets no answer from Mike (turns out he was too terrified to reply)\n\u2022 It's played straight with historical texts from the time of the beginning of the Eldian Empire (over a thousand years before the present). A lot of the confusion about what happened came from how no one can decipher the texts, having only the pictures to go on.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LanguageDrift", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/AttackOnTitan"], "non_media_links": []}
