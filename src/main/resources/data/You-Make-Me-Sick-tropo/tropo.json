{"title": "You Make Me Sick", "content": "This is a very popular Stock Phrase when it comes to a character's moral standards. Usually, it's said in a situation where someone is about to do / did something so terrible or so disgusting or just purely immoral that the other characters just can't hold their tongues.\n\nDespite having a clear line when to say it, the themes and seriousness often change depending on how light or dark the story is. If a hero says it to a villain, it's used to show how monstrous the villain is, but a villain can also say it to the hero, particularly if the latter has done something un-heroic. If a villain says it to another villain, then Even Evil Has Standards, and when a Mook says it to the Big Bad, a Heel\u0096Face Turn is a high possibility. Can also be played for laughs, but not very often.\n\nOther variations are \"You sicken me.\", \"You are disgusting.\", and numerous others.\n\nDon't confuse with You Make Me Sic.
