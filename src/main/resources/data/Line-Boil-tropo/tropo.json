{"title": "Line Boil", "content": "Line boil is the wobble of hand-drawn lines, particularly noticeable when characters are redrawn in every frame even though they are standing still. Early 20th century animators considered line boil an imperfection that should be minimized. Limited Animation deals with line boil by using the same drawing for parts of the character that aren't moving and only re-drawing the parts that move, though this may make the immobile parts seem frozen in place, a problem that occurs in computer animation as well. To avoid this \"freezing\" effect, line boil and other types of wobbling and jittering are sometimes purposely used and even exaggerated.\n\u2022 The first ending to Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood uses exaggerated line boil.\n\u2022 Powerful Beat from Tamagotchi! Yume Kira Dream. It's barely noticeable in Tamagotchi! with Mametchi, even though his outlines are mostly still.\n\u2022 The \"Pop Team Cooking\" sketches in Pop Team Epic make use of this trope as part of their particular art style, which seems to aim more for a \"children's cartoon\" look.\n\u2022 The Pop-Tarts commercials, which draw heavy influence from (but are not made by) Don Hertzfeldt.\n\u2022 Manivald is a rare example of this effect on both the characters and the backgrounds.\n\u2022 The biography portions of Sita Sings the Blues have line boil, one of the four art styles in the movie since the creator didn't want the audience to lose interest.\n\u2022 Freelance cartoonist John Caldwell, whose work has appeared in MAD, animates with exaggerated line boil.\n\u2022 The music video for Aha's \"Take on Me\". Funny enough, line boil was considered extremely undesirable in rotoscoping in the early days of animation.\n\u2022 All the character portraits in Hotel Dusk: Room 215 and Last Window. It was even used in Kyle's trophy for Super Smash Bros. Brawl.\n\u2022 Doki-Doki Universe does this for the cinematics and loading screens.\n\u2022 All sprites in Ittle Dew and Ittle Dew 2.\n\u2022 Every moving sprite in Baba Is You, including the text.\n\u2022 This menu page on the Homestar Runner website.\n\u2022 Grey Gerling (BarfQuestion )'s style of animation. For example the Sock Series.\n\u2022 The more recent installments of the Eddsworld series.\n\u2022 The segments focusing on Bob from Weebl & Bob.\n\u2022 Ed, Edd n Eddy, at least the characters. Lampshaded in \"Smile for the Ed\", with Edd's line, \"Eddy actually thinks he can pass off a crayon drawing as a school photo? I mean, the lines are all wiggly.\"\n\u2022 The pilot episode of Rocko's Modern Life (Trash-O-Madness) featured unusually squiggly lines.\n\u2022 Another Nicktoon, Doug, had squiggly animation in its pilot episode, \"Doug Can't Dance\".\n\u2022 The 1974 British cartoon Roobarb and its second season/sequel, Roobarb and Custard Too, upon where everything including the coloring wobbled.\n\u2022 Henry's Cat, from the creator of Roobarb. Imagine an acid trip, but for toddlers.\n\u2022 One episode of Arthur featured a parody of Dr. Katz, Professional Therapist, with all of the characters drawn this way (see its entry below).\n\u2022 Most of the shorts on O Canada, which included Bob and Margaret, that later became its own show, though seasons 3 and 4 of Bob and Margaret did not feature the line boil effect\n\u2022 The Killing of an Egg (or Ei om Zeep), a 1977 short by Dutch animator Paul Driessen that ran from time to time on Nickelodeon back in the early 1990s.\n\u2022 John K's Simpsons couch gag varies between extremely still lines and extremely boiling lines.\n\u2022 Cartoons animated in Squiggle Vision:\n\u2022 First season of Home Movies (later seasons use non-squiggly Flash animation)\n\u2022 Science Court (which itself was later renamed Squigglevision and slightly reformatted)\n\u2022 Stickin' Around which used software by the name of Boiler Paint unrelated to SquiggleVision. The first season, as well as the 1994 shorts, had both paint and line boil. After that, the line boil was dropped.\n\u2022 Winsor McCay's groundbreaking 1911 short based on his Little Nemo comic strip features this, as well as boiling colors, since each character in the cartoon was hand-drawn and hand-colored.\n\u2022 1914's Gertie the Dinosaur, also by McCay, features it in the background, as the entire drawing had to be retraced for every frame. McCay actually liked the effect, as the unsteadiness of the lines seemed to make the whole scene come alive.\n\u2022 The Big Snit has exaggerated line boil for its characters.\n\u2022 As did Getting Started from the same director, six years prior.\n\u2022 The 1960s Filmation cartoon The New Adventures of Superman has a bit of line boil.\n\u2022 The Henry Hugglemonster episode \"The Mighty Heromonsters\" uses this during scenes in Henry's comic book. This is taken Up to Eleven with the background as well.\n\u2022 Shown most of the time in Tamagotchi Video Adventures.\n\u2022 Your Face and other early works by Bill Plympton feature this, since Plympton drew each panel by hand. It helps reinforce the surreal atmosphere of Plympton's work.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LineBoil", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FullmetalAlchemist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Tamagotchi", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PopTeamEpic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/DonHertzfeldt", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Animation/Manivald", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SitaSingsTheBlues", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aha", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HotelDuskRoom215", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/LastWindow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SuperSmashBros", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Okami", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DokiDokiUniverse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IttleDew", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/IttleDew2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BabaIsYou", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Doug", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Roobarb", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HenrysCat", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PBS", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheCatCameBack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrKatzProfessionalTherapist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheKillingOfAnEgg", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DrKatzProfessionalTherapist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HomeMovies", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ScienceCourt", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StickinAround", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WinsorMcCay", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GertieTheDinosaur", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBigSnit", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Filmation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheNewAdventuresOfSuperman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HenryHugglemonster", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TamagotchiVideoAdventures", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/YourFace", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BillPlympton"], "non_media_links": ["http://www.animationpost.co.uk/notes2/wobble.htm", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitedAnimation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Anime", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Manga", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Commercials", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EasternEuropeanAnimation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Film", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/Mad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Music", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Rotoscoping", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGames", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebAnimation", "http://homestarrunner.com/main9.html", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner", "http://barfquestion.newgrounds.com/", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/SockSeries", "http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/80798", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/BamanPiderman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/WeeblAndBob", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WesternAnimation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SquiggleVision", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/LittleNemo", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven"]}
