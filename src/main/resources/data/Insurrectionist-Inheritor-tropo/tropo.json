{"title": "Insurrectionist Inheritor", "content": "Harry Dresden: Servant, I don't like that word. I suggest that you consider where you stand and choose a different term. My Queen. And you will be gentle with that girl, or so help me I will make you regret it. \n\nMab: Finally, a Knight worth the trouble. Servant, I don't like that word. I suggest that you consider where you stand and choose a different term. My Queen. And you will be gentle with that girl, or so help me I will make you regret it.Finally, a Knight worth the trouble.\n\nThe badass has achieved high rank: king, CEO, crimelord, whatever. He's done so by sticking up for himself and what he believes in, and never taking abuse from anyone. He's pretty settled in when he notices a problem: he's surrounded by gutless yes men. They're weak. They crawl before him. They can't possibly take over his role if he were to step down.\n\nExcept that one guy. Who hates his guts. And quite possibly has tried to kill him.\n\nThat's his new sole heir.\n\nIt doesn't have to go as far as hate and murder. Just being willing to defy, correct and generally stand up to the power figure can qualify.\n\nSince standing up to someone when you're supposed to is easy, this may involve a Secret Test of Character. But the strongest evidence is when the rebellion happens entirely unprompted.\n\nSee also Hire the Critic, The Consigliere and Honest Advisor.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsurrectionistInheritor", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ColdDays", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JoesWorld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SnowCrash", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGrimnoirChronicles", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDiamondAge", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWarGods", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HerculePoirot", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheWheelOfTime", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Angel", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/HigurashiWhenTheyCry", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/GirlGenius", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/OneHundredAndOneDalmatiansTheSeries"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YesMan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InadequateInheritor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretTestOfCharacter", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HireTheCritic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheConsigliere", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HonestAdvisor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HellholePrison", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimeSkip", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFairFolk", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustTheFirstCitizen", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EmperorScientist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheExtremistWasRight", "http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20120113", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlordList"]}
