{"title": "Useless Without Cell Phones", "content": "While cell phones can be useless, at times they can be more handy than we are. Because of them, we have access to every word in the dictionary, can communicate while not being in the same area as your friends, can find out about local and long-distance news as soon as it happens, watch porn in a public area, can shoot lasers out of satellites from space... and also watch every cat video available on YouTube.\n\nBecause of this, sometimes the cell phones are more useful than us, almost to the point of not even needing us to function. In that case, some would be completely helpless without our cell-phones or our tablets or our fancy-pants PCs and Macintoshes. They can't spell correctly, they can't adapt to their surrounding environment, they can't eat anything without submitting pictures of their food onto Twitter and Facebook. They probably wouldn't even know how to turn a page after using Kindle for so long. There is a reason why \"Nomophobia\" (fear of being without a mobile phone) is considered an official term in the psychological community these days. Safe to say, modern conveniences can be considered a necessity for most these days.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UselessWithoutCellphones", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SayonaraZetsubouSensei", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ParksAndRecreation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MitchBenn", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/XKCD", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/YouTube", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS2E22WhenItRains", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CellPhonesAreUseless", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RobotWar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooDumbToLive", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackSpeech", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrazyPrepared", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBlackout", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ListSong", "https://www.xkcd.com/903/", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Wiki/Wikipedia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Smosh", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mA5fCFqqz0", "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0vRcJh1-GQL_V4qm5F6xFw", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Twelthofadime", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_u035J55bdY", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OnlySaneMan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Justified", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheComicallySerious"]}
