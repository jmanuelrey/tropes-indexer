{"title": "\"Getting My Own Room\" Plot", "content": "Getting My Own Room Plot is when a person wants their very own room.\n\nOften seen in a family setting in which one of the children has to share a room with either an Annoying Younger Sibling or a Big Brother Bully and wanting their own room to get as far away from them. Though, being part of a large family with zero privacy will have the same effect. In another case, bickering roommates would end up getting tired of living with each other with one of them wanting to move out.\n\nEspecially in shows where Status Quo Is God, expect the person to actually get their own room or place but suffer a Be Careful What You Wish For situation; since they were so used to the people around them they end up feeling lonely or even scared. When that happens, expect them to go right back to their original room arrangement. In shows that don't care that much about their status quo however, the change is more likely to be permanent.\n\u2022 One Zillow commercial features two brothers roughhousing with the older one asking his parents when will he get his own room.

In the end, her father changes his mind and lets her stay in the nursery a while longer.\n\u2022 Inverted in Frozen.
