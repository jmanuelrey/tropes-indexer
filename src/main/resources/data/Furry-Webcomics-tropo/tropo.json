Completed.\n\u2022 The Fuzzy Princess: A comedy comic about a cat princess from another world who gets stranded on Earth.\n\u2022 Fuzzy Things: A comic about the adventures of eight kids on a planet both mundane and futuristic.

The main character, Jack, is the Sin of Wrath, serving as The Grim Reaper. The comic mainly focuses on separate story arcs of normal people living in a Crapsack World and their problematic situations (often related to impending death), but occasionally you get arcs that dwell deeper into Jack's mysterious past and the constant powerclash between Heaven and Hell \u2014 and sometimes both types of arcs mix together as furries in the living world are played as puppets by higher forces. Also justifies why furries exist and humans don't (anymore). It's extremely complicated and hard to follow, but if you got the time, reread it and it makes WAY more sense each reread. Oh, and it's 1464 comic pages long and gaining as of 6/5/2011.\n\u2022 Jack Legend : A fox has a great ancestry of heroes and masters of their crafts. As the last member of his family line, it is up to Jack (with the help of his sheepish sidekick Buddy) to find his own glory, and make his ancestry proud.\n\u2022 Katinka by J.B.Pawstep.

(There are also has several bonus comics related to the main strip that flesh out side stories or, in the case of bonus comic Breasts Are the Best, provide nothing but fanservice.)\n\u2022 Last Res0rt: A furry violinist volunteers for a lethal Reality Show set in The Future in order to save her Mad Scientist friend, but finds out she's also a vampire. A majority of the characters are furries, including a few Taur species, but there's also some humans and plenty of Half Human Hybrids thrown in as well.\n\u2022 Latchkey Kingdom: Starts as a Zelda parody, quickly gets more unique.\n\u2022 Laugh-Out-Loud Cats AKA Hobotopia: Antics of 2 feline hobos who speak like LOLCats.

It especially focuses on the three children of Fisk and Elizabeth, namely Abigail, Thomas, and Janie. The Comic has recently gone slightly astray though going back to resemble Better Days, though it is now censored.\n\u2022 Outside Interference: A newspaper-strip style comic hosted on DeviantArt, revolving around the everyday lives and random incidents of a slowly-expanding group of 'anthropomorphic British cartoon animals.

One of the parents is an eccentric but kindly dragon, adding a note of fantasy to the proceedings. Influenced by Peanuts, Pogo, and Calvin and Hobbes, but has a flavor all its own.\n\u2022 The Packrat: The now monthly told tales of a severely synthesizer-addicted rodent. Made by Dave Lovelace, the creator of Retarded Animal Babies. The current strips, but not all past strips, are also available in the Keyboards Magazine.\n\u2022 Pandect: Drama/comedy. Set about 20-50 years in the future in Asia, posits the existence of Aces (animals who have earned human souls and can take human appearance). Aces are always completely animal or completely human, so this is not a furry comic in the classic sense.\n\u2022 Panthera: A webcomic about a group of high school teens who transform into Big Cats in order to help their chemistry teacher wage war on some kind of \"Evil Organization\". Better that it sounds. Good artwork.\n\u2022 Paprika: The prequel and sequel to Caribbean Blue.\n\u2022 Peter and Company: Everybody thinks Peter is crazy and talking to an imaginary friend.

It's a love story about what happens after you get the girl. It's a business adventure/romance webcomic.\" All of those things are true at various times in the strip's run.
