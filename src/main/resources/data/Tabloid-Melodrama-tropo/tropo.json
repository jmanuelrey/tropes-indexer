{"title": "Tabloid Melodrama", "content": "[reading] \"The reign of Mr. Adams has hitherto been one continued tempest of malignant passions. As president, he has never opened his lips without threatening or scolding. He is a repulsive pedant, a gross hypocrite, one of the most egregious fools upon the continent, a hideous, hermaphroditical character which has neither the force and firmness of a man, nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.\"It is beneath the President of the United States to take any notice of insinuations.In any other country, such filth would have been silenced long ago.Mr. Hamilton takes equal pains to ensure that the Federalist Paper are filled with scurrilous attacks on Thomas Jefferson and his party.Think of all the vile falsehoods written about you\u2014continue to be written about you. You may have patiently borne all the slanders, but I have not. \"Before it is too late to retrieve our deranged affairs\u2014\"For goodness sake.[continues reading] \"\u2014 the people must demand the immediate resignation of old, querulous, bald, blind, crippled, toothless Adams.\"I find no amusement in this. Waste of paper and ink.Waste of time reading it, Abigail. Put it down.They would not say such a thing about Washington. They would not call George Washington hermaphroditical!They could call him toothless, though.
