{"title": "Rationalizing the Overkill", "content": "\"You aimed for my head. You've got to know that a blow like that can kill a guy, right? That means you were deliberately trying to kill me, right? That means whatever happens next... IS WHAT YOU DESERVE, RIGHT?\"\n\nWhen a character wrongs another character, the victim is more likely to get back at them, usually by giving them the same treatment they gave to them. Seems fair, does it? Not quite. That's not enough to satisfy the victim. So why not dish out some Disproportionate Retribution? Wait, that's going too far! Then again, it doesn't matter to the character as long as \"justice\" is served.\n\nThis is when a character sees their excessive punishment on another as completely justified. Perhaps the character has been abused for far too long from their tormentor(s) and that going overboard with their revenge is exactly how they feel, which is quite common with a bullied character turning into a villain. Perhaps they may be a self-righteous Knight Templar who puts too much value in morality and any \"just\" and \"righteous\" punishment must be extremely harsh. Perhaps the guy wants to Make an Example of Them, whether they're a Knight Templar or a mob boss who wants to enforce the rules for his underlings and/or the people around them. For whatever reason, this will demonstrate how vengeful the character is and they have already allowed revenge to consume them so terribly.\n\nIn another variations, an unsympathetic character is suffering tremendously and other characters, especially those who were wronged, will tell them that they deserve what was coming to them as opposed to others who feel that they didn't deserve a punishment like that, even if the character was a jerk.\n\nSubtrope of There Is No Kill Like Overkill. Compare It's the Only Way to Be Sure, Make Sure He's Dead. An Asshole Victim can be subject to this. See also Minor Injury Overreaction. Contrast Was Too Hard on Him if the character regrets punishing a character very harshly. Can be a unique way to refute a What the Hell, Hero? speech from other characters who think they've done enough damage. Also contrast Restrained Revenge, where the character's \"justified\" punishment isn't excessive.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalizingTheOverkill", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/Durarara", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/FateZero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BattlestarGalactica2003", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RaumschiffGamestar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheJewOfMalta", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ChristopherMarlowe", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMerchantOfVenice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ProfessorLaytonAndTheUnwoundFuture", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretWorld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SchlockMercenary", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheDreamstone", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ATasteOfTheirOwnMedicine", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PayEvilUntoEvil", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhosLaughingNow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackAndWhiteInsanity", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeAnExampleOfThem", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KnightTemplar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeWhoFightsMonsters", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickTheSonOfABitch", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereIsNoKillLikeOverkill", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItsTheOnlyWayToBeSure", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakeSureHesDead", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinorInjuryOverreaction", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WasTooHardOnHim", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RestrainedRevenge", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/EscapeFromTheHokagesHat", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWho2005CSTheChristmasInvasion", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS28E13Doomsday", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hell", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffingTheOffspring", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillEmAll", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsentMindedProfessor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BunnyEarsLawyer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EruditeStoner", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadScientist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleIncident", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DemoReel", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KickThemWhileTheyAreDown", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoistByTheirOwnPetard"]}
