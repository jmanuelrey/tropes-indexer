{"title": "Living on Borrowed Time", "content": "And now it turns out that the Administrator has one too, this one being implanted in her arm. Though in her case, even the life extender can't keep her alive indefinitely. She doesn't care, because she still has just enough time to \"settle an old debt\".\n\nTheir lost brother, Gray, also has one of these. His entire reason for taking over Mann Co. is to get more australium for his particular machine. Though unlike his siblings, whose life extenders are large enough to have to be wheeled around with them, his is small enough implanted in his upper back and he can walk around freely..\n\nAsriel. In the past, Asriel was a little boy that was murdered by humans and he was reincarnated as a flower without a soul called Flowey. In the pacifist route, Flowey absorbs 6 human souls and the soul of every monster to not only regain his true form as Asriel, but also has incredible power. After the player character defeats him with compassion and love, Asriel reverts into his child form and returns the souls he had stolen. Asriel then states that Flowey and himself are so different from each other that they should be considered as two totally different people. Since Asriel gave up the souls he stole, he tells the player character that it's only a matter of time until he reverts back into his Flowey form and the Asriel they see will be gone forever, which is why he chooses to stay behind in the underground and not see his parents. He can be found and spoken to in the Epilogue, but if the player restarts the game after the credits, Asriel is gone and only Flowey is there.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LivingOnBorrowedTime", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Undertale"], "non_media_links": []}
