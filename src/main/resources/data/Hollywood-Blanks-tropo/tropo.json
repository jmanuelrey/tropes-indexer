{"title": "Hollywood Blanks", "content": "Guns are dangerous. It's kind of their purpose. Sometimes, though, our heroes need a way to make it look like they're shooting someone when they aren't. Enter the Hollywood Blank.\n\nIn Real Life, blanks are not so harmless, and mishandling them can (and has) resulted in the deaths of actors. A bullet is propelled by igniting pressurized gunpowder, creating a small, controlled explosion that forces it out through the barrel. Blank cartridges don't contain a bullet, but take a guess which part of the process is still included. At close range, the high-pressure and extremely hot gases generated from the explosion can fracture bones, severely burn soft tissue and drive parts of brass casings and paper/plastic wadding into the flesh.\n\nIn fiction, however, blanks are completely harmless, producing nothing more than a loud noise and a flash of light. Also commonly seen are characters using unmodified weapons with blanks. Manually-operated firearms like revolvers and bolt-action rifles indeed can be used without modification. But automatic and semi-automatic guns must be extensively modified in order to cycle blanks properly, such as partially blocking off the barrel, and cannot be used with live ammo afterwards.\n\nShows up almost all the time in fiction, making this an Omnipresent Trope. As such, no need for examples played straight; just aversions and inversions.\n\nA Sub-Trope of Guns Do Not Work That Way.
