{"title": "Overdrive", "content": "Yes, that's the one for Overdrive!\n\n\"The pod race in the film suffers from a common trope, in which characters needing to go somewhere really fast head off in their vehicle. At some point they realise they're not going to make it in time, so they open the throttle all the way and go even faster. The question of course being why weren't they going as fast as they possibly could already?\"\n\nA character needs to drive somewhere quickly. Maybe they're in a car race, or maybe they're just racing against time. At one point, they realize they're not going to make it in time. So they... go faster. Huh? Why didn't they just drive that fast to begin with?\n\nOdd as it may seem, this unexplained increase in speed can have some basis in reality. It can be simplified as a cost vs. benefit decision. If somebody has 'nothing to lose' and must be somewhere at a certain time then they have to speed up - BUT - if they push their machine too hard it will fail before they get there. If they had backed off slightly, then it could have broken down after they had arrived. In a race a driver will hold back simply because there's a notable difference between \"the fastest they can drive\" and \"the fastest they can continuously drive without wear and tear completely destroying the engine halfway through the race\". Smart drivers limit themselves to the former, and use the engine-wrecking speeds in short bursts\u2014or for those desperate final laps.\n\nFuel consumption is also a potential problem. Having to find out where to refuel in the middle of some prairie or ocean is not a way to get to destination ASAP. Running out of propellant halfway to the next planet and thus unable to decelerate is not a good idea either. The cost of fuel, oil (or Helium-3, or whatever) and repairs is also a factor. In most cases engines are supposed to work much longer than one or two rides and generally engines aren't so cheap that the cost of damaging one could be disregarded without a really good reason.\n\nThen there are Nitro Boost systems, which are of limited duration by definition, and speed limits. On normal roads, a driver may initially be unwilling to flagrantly violate the speed limit\u2014and risk bringing the ire of the police down on them\u2014until they get really desperate.\n\nFinally, it might be a matter of safety. Crashing and burning is not an effective way to reach a destination, and the driver may initially only be going as fast as they feel comfortable going... until they realize its not enough, and they just have to risk it.\n\nOf course, in spite of the risks associated with such insane speed, it almost invariably results in victory for our protagonist, rather than catastrophic engine breakdown in the penultimate lap. Ludicrous Speed laughs at your puny physics and mechanical stress limits!\n\nAnd of course, there are some instances\u2014say, short drag races\u2014where this trope makes absolutely no sense no matter how you slice it.\n\nIf the villain does this, don't worry. Dick Dastardly Stops to Cheat, every time.\n\nA Sub-Trope of Holding Back the Phlebotinum and Miracle Rally when it's in a race. A Sister Trope of Tim Taylor Technology, and the mechanical equivalent of a Dangerous Forbidden Technique. If it involves the risk of a catastrophic failure, it's Explosive Overclocking.\n\nClose to, but not to be confused with, the Final Fantasy X move called Overdrive (which is listed under Limit Break).", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverDrive", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SpeedRacer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DarthsAndDroids", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyX", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/TheVisionOfEscaflowne", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/InitialD", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/FinalFantasy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StarWars", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ThePhantomMenace", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Cars", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GalaxyQuest", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TrueGrit", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CitiesInFlight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HonorHarrington", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SwordOfTruth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarTrek", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheNextGeneration", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KnightRider", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StreetHawk", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/BattleTech", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Motorstorm", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RomancingSaGa", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarWarsEpisodeIRacer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FZero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Dogyuun", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SonicTheHedgehogCD", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MarioParty", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArmoredCore", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DarthsAndDroids", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TaleSpin", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongebobSquarepants"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhlebotinumBreakdown", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NitroBoost", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousSpeed", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DickDastardlyStopsToCheat", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldingBackThePhlebotinum", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiracleRally", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SisterTrope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TimTaylorTechnology", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DangerousForbiddenTechnique", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LimitBreak", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LudicrousSpeed", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FinalBattle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuperSpeed", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoweredArmor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/HalfLifeFullLifeConsequences", "http://www.lakupo.com/qu/fanfics/cid_wars.html", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MST3KMantra", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImportedAlienPhlebotinum", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MadeOfIndestructium", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayAndStoryIntegration", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromHitPoints", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilKnockoff", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeflectorShields", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/MechWarrior", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NitroBoost", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumongousMecha", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpacePlane", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TankGoodness", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TanksButNoTanks", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OverHeating", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelEditor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WackyRacing", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoverTank", "http://www.darthsanddroids.net/episodes/0105.html", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheRant", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SugarWiki/FunnyMoments", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrivingStick", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_emergency_power", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFifties", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS_Carpathia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/USefulNotes/RMSTitanic", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/9158258/Titanic-sank-due-to-mirage-caused-by-freak-weather.html", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overclocking", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExplosiveOverclocking", "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/extreme-fear-superhuman/"]}
