{"title": "Free Prize at the Bottom", "content": "At least as much nutritional value as actual cereal!\n\n\"The first hazard to watch out for are cereals that include anything grown in Iowa in the name. [...] Those cereals only ever put fitness-related crap in their specially-marked boxes. [...] What you do want to look for are cereals with sound effects in the name\u2014\"Smacks\", \"Pops\", \"Puffs\", \"Blasts\", and, um... \"Gunshots in a Crowded Mall\" . You know, the kind with the squarish sugared pieces of styrofoam they claim are marshmallows. These are guaranteed to have a nice big reach-your-nasty-unwashed-hand-straight-to-the-bottom-of-the-box toy in it.\"\n\nA once-standard marketing strategy for breakfast cereals and other products meant for children was to put some sort of \"prize\" at the bottom of the package\u2014typically something plastic and useless, but still pretty cool to the target audience. Cracker Jack , having started this practice in 1912, was likely the first to do so. Unfortunately, repeated instances of children simply disregarding the notice of a prize contained inside and scarfing down the contents and choking on the toys led to the widespread abolition of this practice, in some cases by legislation, in others by the willing initiative of the companies manufacturing the product for the sake of avoiding lawsuits. Cracker Jack \"Prizes\" are now just little paper squares that have little puzzles and stickers on them that even little kids realize are lame, and just end up being thrown away. As a result, the term is nowadays used as an analogy for something very cheap.\n\nIn fiction, when characters notice the free prize at the bottom label on their box of cereal (or other package), they will attempt to cash in immediately. This means employing a method of getting past the actual product, such as sticking one's entire arm into the box and digging around while pieces of food fall out. More innovative characters will come up with a less messy method. In some cases, they find that the prize is missing and may have already been taken. Sometimes in animation, a character, particularly a Big Eater, will scarf down the prize.\n\nSince this strategy is specifically used to sell to kids (or, more accurately, their parents), it is most often seen referenced in cartoons, comic strips and other media that are considered as being meant for children, although that's not always the case.\n\nFor decades, in the United States DUZ detergent was sold with a piece of glassware in the box.\n\nShokugan is an inversion that exists in Japan. The main product being sold is a good quality toy, packaged with a pitifully small amount of cheap candy or snacks.\n\nCompetition Coupon Madness is a variant. While that trope deals with the collection of box tops or some other part of a product package and sending away for the prize via mail, this trope is for situations where the prize is immediately available in the package itself.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreePrizeAtTheBottom", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/CollegeHumor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/SpiderMan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/OurMissBrooks", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/UHF", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhileYouWereSleeping", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ANightmareOnElmStreetPart2FreddysRevenge", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDictator", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Spaceballs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndTheChocolateFactory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRestaurantAtTheEndOfTheUniverse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWizard", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NightCourt", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodies", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Scrubs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Psych", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Monk", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheAmandaShow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/AllThat", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCosbyShow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/MeatLoaf", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/WeirdAlYankovic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ghostbusters", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheSecretOfMonkeyIsland", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/EerieCuties", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/EightBitTheater", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/CollegeHumor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PhineasAndFerb", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SpongeBobSquarePants", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TazMania", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CowAndChicken", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAngryBeavers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FamilyGuy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JeremyIrons", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TimothyGoesToSchool", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Caillou", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Franklin", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JohnnyTest", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Kaeloo", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CharlieAndLola", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Ben10", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IfYouGiveAMouseACookie"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/HomestarRunner", "http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail194.html", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreadEggsMilkSquick", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracker_Jack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UrExample", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigEater", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatDoYouMeanItsNotForKids", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CompetitionCouponMadness", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Comicbook/Supergirl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithThisRing", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Cloudcuckoolander", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManChild", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicFeather", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakfastAtTiffanys", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GreasySpoon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pun", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChocolateFrostedSugarBombs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StylisticSuck", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/FoxTrot", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoryArc", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Peanuts", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SundayStrip", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Garfield", "https://garfield.com/comic/1988/11/28", "https://garfield.com/comic/1990/08/04", "https://garfield.com/comic/1997/11/19", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/ForBetterOrForWorse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheFarSide", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/CalvinAndHobbes", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/StrongBadEmail", "http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail194.html", "http://www.eeriecuties.com/d/20110207.html", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoodSwinger", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FoeYay", "http://www.nuklearpower.com/2005/03/15/episode-527-imprisoned-with-the-fools/", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RGB2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RGB2iOs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RGB2iOs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Exploitedtrope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GottaCatchEmAll", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TitleDrop", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStinger"]}
