{"title": "Inconveniently Vanishing Exonerating Evidence", "content": "A character is attacked and uses a weapon to kill his attacker in self-defence, but his attacker's weapon disappears by the time the police arrive at the scene. Perhaps the weapon just happens to fall somewhere inaccessible, but sometimes one of the attacker's accomplices steals it or maybe one of the officers just sticks it in his pocket and walks away. Either way, the character has no way to prove that his attacker was armed and that his actions were in retaliation, so he finds himself charged with murder.\n\nA variation involves a murderer killing someone, then stealing (or otherwise disposing of) a weapon belonging to the person they are looking to frame, so that they cannot prove their weapon was not the one used in the crime.\n\nA Sister Trope to Better Manhandle the Murder Weapon, Inconveniently Vanishing Exonerating Evidence provides another means for having a character accused of murder.\n\nCan overlap with This Was His True Form if the hero is unable to convince the authorities that someone was a rampaging beast when he killed him.\n\nCompare/contrast Shoot Him! He Has a... Wallet. Also compare It Was Here, I Swear!, when an entire location disappears by the time the authorities arrive.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InconvenientlyVanishingExoneratingEvidence", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BatmanEternal", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LuckyLuke", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ConAir", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BlueSteel", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AfterTheThinMan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheShawshankRedemption", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/BladeTrinity", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fallen", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SherlockHolmes", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ArtemisFowl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DifferentSeasons", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FrontierCircus", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSICrimeSceneInvestigation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HillStreetBlues", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/PersonOfInterest", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StargateSG1", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dragnet", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FallingSkies", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheATeam", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheCloser", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SpacePrecinct", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EarlyEdition", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Hamilton", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AssassinsCreed2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheGaryColemanShow"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KillingInSelfDefense", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBadGuysAreCops", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SisterTrope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BetterManhandleTheMurderWeapon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThisWasHisTrueForm", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootHimHeHasAWallet", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItWasHereISwear", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningAwayToTheCircus", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DirtyCop", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssassinOutclassin", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StargateSG1S8E8Covenant", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionToOneChance", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiotBall"]}
