{"title": "Fourth Wall Shut In Story", "content": "Subtrope of Trapped in Another World, but the hero has intimate knowledge of the world he's in... because he's the one that created it, perhaps moreso a variation of Pygmalion Plot. For this to have conflict, however, not everything is as it appears, he no longer has author...ity, or he didn't realize the problems he was creating, and is as bound to the rules of the world as those he created. The author might be seen as a god of his own world, and worshipped for it, or hated for the problems he made.\n\nIn the web-novel The Administrator , a sick girl spends years in the hospital creating a detailed Fantasy setting in order to stave off boredom - and after she dies, she gets reincarnated in that very setting (with, as the title implies, Admin powers). She resolves to make the best of her new life, though she is less than enthusiastic about the parts of the world that she designed when she was eight years old", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourthWallShutInStory", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAdventuresOfSharkboyAndLavagirl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Delirious", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Mirrormask", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Monkeybone", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/KurtVonnegut", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BreakfastOfChampions", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheInkworldTrilogy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/PamelaDean", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheSecretCountry", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TypewriterInTheSky", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKidsInTheHall", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Aha", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ComixZone", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ViewtifulJoe"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PygmalionPlot", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JustForPun", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInTVLand", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AsYouWishPrince", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapOpera", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS6E2TheMindRobber", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/Dilbert", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/DestroyTheGodmodder", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XtremeKoolLetterz", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MovieLand", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Avallanath", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheAdministrator", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IllGirl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldShame"]}
