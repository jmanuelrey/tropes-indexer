{"title": "Slippery as an Eel", "content": "Of all the sea creatures in the world, alongside dolphins, octopuses, sea otters , and whales, the sneakiest sea creature alongside the shark would be the moray eel.

Making the best out of it, it bites people in the face.\n\u2022 One of the nastier bizarre Alternate History animals generated by the time waves in A Sound of Thunder is a gigantic eel. It uses ambush tactics for its initial attack on the hero, then bends its body like a hairpin to line up its jaws for another strike, while coiling its tail around him like a constrictor snake.\n\u2022 In Freddi Fish, Eddie the Eel is depicted as a trickster who prevents Freddi and Luther from trying to go where they needed to, unless he is bribed.\n\u2022 Volteel Biblio from Mega Man Zero 3 is a very sneaky character, his level being particularly trap-infested and snaking through secret passages all over his Boss Fight arena to get the drop on you, being That One Boss of the game.\n\u2022 Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag: Spotted moray eels can be found hiding in seaweed, and they do attack Edward.\n\u2022 Super Mario Bros. examples:\n\u2022 Unagi the Eel is an infamous example from Super Mario 64. While not necessarily malicious, it does not appear to like Mario, as it will start roaring and swimming around if he comes close and contact with it causes damage. Unagi later becomes a type of enemy in New Super Mario Bros., and return for Super Mario Odyssey now looking less cartoony and more like the demonic morays they were always meant to be.\n\u2022 Eely-Mouth from Super Mario Sunshine is a monster eel (that appears to be a hermaphrodite, oddly enough; some species are sequential hermaphrodites in real life) whose teeth are so bad that they somehow infect the water in Noki Bay, meaning Mario and FLUDD must go and clean things up, yet again.\n\u2022 Eels appear as enemies in Super Mario Galaxy.\n\u2022 Ogura, the Big Bad of the first two games in the Starfy series.\n\u2022 Kaiju Combat: Moratitan the giant moray is not particularly friendly.\n\u2022 Carrie's Order Up! has Reginald, an eel businessman, complete with hat and suitcase.

Both are predator species, and use their respective characteristics to lure prey into range of attack.\n\u2022 Bug has red coloured moray eels as enemies in Quaria.
