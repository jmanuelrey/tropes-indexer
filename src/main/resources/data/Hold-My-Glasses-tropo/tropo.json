{"title": "Hold My Glasses", "content": "Two people who are established enemies come into contact with each other, there is an intense verbal battle, and a fight is the next logical step. The preparation begins: Maybe they'll psych each other out a bit, circle each other and spout insults, perhaps. But before the brawl goes down, they must remove items of clothing that would impede them. In this aspect, the trope is closely related to The Coats Are Off. Usually earrings, glasses or other such items are removed.\n\nThis is where Hold My Glasses comes in. One or possibly both opponents will calmly remove the aforementioned articles (most likely, earrings will come off first), and they will hand those articles off to the nearest bystander. This is usually the evidence that supports the suspicions of an impending battle.\n\nNote that this doesn't always have to happen after a verbal battle. It can happen as a reaction to a particularly offensive statement, or it can be used as a threat. This works for any accessory/prop, and it is also used for comedic effect. The opponents are also almost Always Female, as it is usually a part of a Cat Fight or Designated Girl Fight.\n\nContrast You Wouldn't Hit a Guy with Glasses?. Not to be confused with the expression \"Hold my beer\" or \"Hold my drink\" \u2014 though, sure, that could be expressed as \"Hold my glass\" \u2014 which started out as part of a stock joke format and then turned into an Internet meme, although the ideas involved are similar. (\"Hold my beer\" is said by someone in a joke or story just before they do something suicidally foolish, not usually involving getting into a fight.)", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HoldMyGlasses", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/OnePiece", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/GreenLantern", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlueBeetle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PaulBlartMallCop", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SLCPunk", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JackieChan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ScaryMovie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheManWithTheGoldenArm", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/TylerPerry", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/EncyclopediaBrown", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HowIMetYourMother", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Victorious", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SixFeetUnder", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TrueBlood", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Shadowgirls", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCoatsAreOff", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlwaysFemale", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatFight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignatedGirlFight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouWouldntHitAGuyWithGlasses", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurbStompBattle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ViolentGlaswegian", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatchPhrase", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoseTwoBadGuys", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyGay", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheStoner", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InvertedTrope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PintsizedPowerhouse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shoryuken", "http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hold-my-flower", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicRapBattlesOfHistory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpellBook", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BattleButler", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BadassNormal"]}
