Did you see that?\n\nThis is a Reaction Shot, where a character pretends to be surprised at the sight of another character or an item. The trope is commonly used as a response when one encountered an event or a person that they already expected, as either a Deadpan Snarker or otherwise a bad actor/liar. As the actor in question was either doing it for the snarks or awkwardly improvising to avoid further awkwardness, this is always played for laughs.\n\nA variation of this would be where one character would say to the other \"Fancy meeting you here!\", even though the first character already knew that the other character would be there.\n\nMay be used as a weapon of choice for either a Deadpan Snarker or a Tsundere.\n\nCan often overlap with a Suspiciously Specific Denial.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MockSurpriseReaction", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Garfield", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Garfield", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/TheBlackEyedPeas", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LargerThanLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DanceFlick", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SaveTheLastDance", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Jumbo", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MenInBlack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheBennyHillShow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/UpstairsDownstairs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/VeronicaMars", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheWire", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/MuchAdoAboutNothing", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarTrekOnline", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TeamFortress2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/CrimsonDark", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BenCroshaw", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GolanTheInsatiable", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReactionShot", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Tsundere", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuspiciouslySpecificDenial", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6B2tKMg3B8", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingCyrano", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReallyGetsAround", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefugeInAudacity", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BelligerentSexualTension", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StarTrekOnlineFoundryBaitAndSwitch", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCaptain", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowWithinAShow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/DrHorriblesSingAlongBlog", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/Jerma985", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2-8mhdDHdg", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/STAR", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LetsPlay/LetsDrownOut", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/FuturamaS2E16AnthologyOfInterestI", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DiscussedTrope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlashForward"]}
