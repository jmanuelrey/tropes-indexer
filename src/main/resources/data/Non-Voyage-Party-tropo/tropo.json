{"title": "Non Voyage Party", "content": "Misunderstandings are a big part of comedy. People hear part of a conversation, or hear it without context, and, well, Hilarity Ensues.\n\nNon Voyage Party is another trope from the comic misunderstandings family. Alice is throwing a party for Bob to celebrate some accomplishment or special occasion of Bob's. Of course Alice and company want it to be a happy surprise, so their circle of friends keeps it on the hushhush. Unfortunately Bob, overhearing part of the plans or seeing his friends sneak around without context, ends up with the mistaken idea that Alice is really trying to get rid of him and is throwing a party to celebrate his imminent departure.\n\nOf course the trope usually resolves with the confused party getting the story straight and being embarrassed and/or amused that they could have been so far off from the truth of the matter, and Everybody Laughs Ending closes it out as the silly misunderstanding is put to rest.\n\nEven in scenarios where commonplace technology would usually prevent this sort of thing from happening, malfunction or human error can be expected to keep the trope on track. If Alice sends a group text to the circle of friends about their plans, except for Bob, one of the friends will reply to it but forget to omit Bob's name so he gets one mysterious text, and no response from the friend who sent it and now realizes their mistake.\n\nNot to be confused with It's a Costume Party, I Swear!.
