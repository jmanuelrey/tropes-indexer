It was absurd, since the writing of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary, but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether.He did not do so, however, because he knew that it was useless.

The clever trick here, since in most stories the government has no access to these thoughts, is that it trains the oppressed to oppress themselves via internalizing what is seen as disapproved thought.\n\nIf a reason is ever given at all, apart from the obvious, Thoughtcrime can be explained as \"intrusive thoughts,\" and their repression leads to \"a happier society\".\n\nIt is nearly impossible to remove Thoughtcrime policies once enacted. The definition tends to expand until whistleblowing is illegal\u2014after all, only a communist/fascist/atheist/religious fanatic etc. would be deceptive enough to claim that our glorious and beneficent regime could possibly make errors, suffer from wishful thinking, or be corrupt.\n\nOf course, by inherent nature, trying to not think what they forbid you to think about will always fail - and expect one or two citizens to be trapped by this thought process and then get captured by the Secret Police (or worse) for their \"trouble\". Taken to extremes, this may lead to everyone getting punished.\n\nNaturally, when no one is allowed to guard the guards, the guards abuse their power left, right and center. Add to that the fact that no person or organization on this earth is capable of getting everything right, and even the best-intentioned crimethink laws end up convincing people that their purpose is to keep the masses from knowing too much.\n\nOverlaps with Culture Police. Compare with The Heretic, for a religious equivalent. Related to The Evils of Free Will. In more nuanced stories, some of these guys sincerely believe they're using Brainwashing for the Greater Good. For others, it's just business as usual. As a means of propaganda, if the methods combating Thoughtcrime are known to the public, the government (or their corporate benefactors) might attempt to paint it in a lighter vein by calling them Enhanced Interrogation Techniques. Political Correctness Gone Mad often occurs when a free, democratic society is the one that tries to codify such rules.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoughtCrime", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NemesisTheWarlock", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/TwoThousandAD", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/AndersonPsiDivision", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/NemesisTheWarlock", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/ThePunisher2099", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Injustice2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/InjusticeVsMastersOfTheUniverse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Low", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/THX1138", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Equilibrium", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Fortress1992", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MinorityReport", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ChristianNation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NineteenEightyFour", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarrisonBergeron", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Victoria", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekVoyager", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonFive", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/Prince", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBible", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheFourGospels", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Mindjammer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SluggyFreelance", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdHominem", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherIsWatching", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HalfTruth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessIsMandatory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWatchesTheWatchmen", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptablePoliticalTargets", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AcceptableReligiousTargets", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThoughtAversionFailure", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhoWatchesTheWatchmen", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DontShootTheMessage", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CulturePolice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeretic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEvilsOfFreeWill", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashingForTheGreaterGood", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnhancedInterrogationTechniques", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnderwaterCity", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/EquestriaAHistoryRevealed", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LemonyNarrator", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoCrazyAnymore", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterComputer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Hypocrisy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HappinessIsMandatory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlackMarket", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretPolice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfLibertarianismAndAuthoritarianism", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MutantDraftBoard", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheBoondocks", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RightForTheWrongReasons", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHeretic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SevenDeadlySins", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutgrownSuchSillySuperstitions", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsBad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrwellianEditor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableRogue", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumansAreFlawed", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuccessionCrisis", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShootTheMessenger", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NewYorkCity", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NaziGermany", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgement", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheGulag", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoralGuardians", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewRockAndRoll", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MuggingTheMonster", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalCorrectnessGoneMad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewMediaAreEvil", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheNewRockAndRoll", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeDegreesOfMurder", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanCourts", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YearZero", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW3vil_cJ7I", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WouldntHurtAChild"]}
