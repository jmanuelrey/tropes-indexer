You hadn't exactly gone out of your way to call attention to them, had you? I mean, like actually telling anybody or anything. \n\nProsser: But the plans were on display... \n\nArthur: On display?

It was on display in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'Beware of the Leopard'.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EscalatingPunchline", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy1"], "non_media_links": []}
