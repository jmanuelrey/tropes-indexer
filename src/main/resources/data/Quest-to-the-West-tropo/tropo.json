{"title": "Quest to the West", "content": "So you're reading a story/watching a movie/playing a game and someone, usually The Protagonist, has to embark on a journey somewhere. Maybe The Hero has to go rescue the oppressed, maybe it's a family migrating to a place where they hope to live better lives, maybe someone has to escape a powerful enemy. Whatever the case, it's very likely that they'll be headed west.\n\nSeveral circumstances conspire together to make west the direction to go:\n\nGoing west means our hero(es) will be coming from the east, which means the sun will rise behind them. It is widely accepted that the sun is a metaphor for light and all that is good and righteous. Similarly, dawn is a metaphor for new beginnings and hopes. So going west is a sort of Visual Metaphor, showing that our hero is bringing new hopes for better life with them. Furthermore, from a cinematic prospective, it makes for a very heroic and awesome shot.\n\nAnother reason has to do with recent history. When the European nations entered their expansionist periods, they started going north, east, and south. To the west was a vast and dangerous ocean. When Europe was running out of room, they tried going west and found a continent that was entirely new. So \"west\" became the direction of exploration, challenge, and great rewards. As America became colonized and then independent, and the United States purchased the Louisiana territory, west was STILL waiting for European-descended explorers, and held challenge and land for anyone who could defend their territory. This concept was further promoted by the discovery of gold in the western and northwestern mountains, prompting the Gold Rushes as people flocked successively further and further westward to seek riches and fortune on the frontier. These events are still recent in a sense to the human race, and so \"west\" has become associated with \"frontier\", \"adventure\" and \"unknown\" tropes, and the braving of great risks for great rewards.\n\nIn the Eastern world, the passage of the great ocean seemed impossible, so Japan was the furthest East one could travel. If one wished to explore new things, then West to the mountains is where you had to go.\n\nNote: this trope is for when the journey west has symbolism and meaning beyond just \"Character X happens to go west\". For examples to count, they have to imply a new life, a quest or an adventure of some sort. If our heroes are heading west only at the end of the plot this is Riding into the Sunset.\n\nThis trope is frequently used to start a Cowboy Episode. A Left-Justified Fantasy Map can lead to this if the characters are interested in crossing the sea. For the video game equivalent see When All Else Fails, Go Right.
