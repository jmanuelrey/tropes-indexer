{"title": "Hospital Surprise", "content": "Basically, a character is in a situation it seems no one could survive, and later they turn up clinging to life in a hospital.\n\nThe situation looks bad. Alice and Bob have been bruised, beaten, cut, and shot. On top of that, the Mooks are closing in. They look up to see The Cavalry, but it's too late. Carol, riding alongside The Cavalry, sees the two go down fighting. Cut to the next scene. Alice wakes up in a hospital, surprised to be alive. She's taken to see Bob, who tells her 'At least I got to see you one last time, old friend.'\n\nDue to the Rule of Drama, it's common for major characters in fiction to be Left for Dead or placed in a No One Could Survive That! scenario. However, as shown in the Sorting Algorithm of Deadness, it's much less common for major characters to be Killed Off for Real this way. Sometimes the character just turns up later unharmed, sometimes an Unexplained Recovery is lampshaded by \"I got better\" or the like, but sometimes the writer wants to Take a Third Option. Usually the 'surviving' characters are told 'there's someone who wants to see you', and there they are, clinging to life. Sometimes the rescue is shown, often in flashback, to highlight the rescuer as well as the victim, while other times the character just turns up later this way. Having a character hospitalized after a dramatic moment gives writers additional options that can be Played for Drama, for example:\n\u2022 Clear up loose ends and add realism, showing the character may have gotten away, but not unscathed.\n\u2022 Highlight the character as being physically vulnerable enough that their life was really in jeopardy.\n\u2022 Suggest the character was literally saved in the nick of time.\n\u2022 Suggest the character survived more through force of will than dumb luck.\n\nIn some cases, this is used as a Double Subversion of No One Could Survive That! by having the character die in the hospital. Often used to allow the hero or villain an Obi-Wan Moment rather than having them Killed Mid-Sentence.\n\nIt can also be Played for Laughs if the character is hospitalized after a situation that didn't appear life-threatening or is convinced they are dead and wondering why the afterlife seems strangely familiar, flirting with the 'angels', etc.\n\nSPOILER ALERT: This is one of those rare tropes that, by its very nature, has the potential to spoil an ending simply by revealing it occurs within a certain medium.
