{"title": "Vehicular Theme Naming", "content": "Eagle was a nameplate Chrysler invented to sell the Renault/AMC joint venture cars when they bought out the latter (the name originated from the proto-crossover AMC Eagle); after the Renault agreement ended Chrysler used it mainly as a way to badge-engineer Mitsubishi models, and the brand, given its' lack of a plan and its' overlap with other marques, was dead by 1998. As for Geo, it was essentially an \"import fighter\" created by Chevrolet based mainly off Suzuki models, and it too was dead by the late 90s, though some models were subsumed into the Chevy lineup and remained there well into the 2000s", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VehicularThemeNaming", "media_links": [], "non_media_links": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autozam_AZ-1"]}
