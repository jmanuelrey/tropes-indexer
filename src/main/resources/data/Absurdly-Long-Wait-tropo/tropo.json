{"title": "Absurdly Long Wait", "content": "You need to wait for things, that's a fact of life, and cannot avoid it. Waiting for an appointment with the doctor, waiting for your pizza, or just waiting for the street light to change. But if you are lucky, you won't have to wait long.\n\nExcept in fiction, where you are never lucky, not only you will never wait bare minimum, but the actual time you need to wait will be stupidly long. Things that normally would take hours, at most, will take days, or even weeks! And if something normally takes weeks, well...you can expect to be waiting for a few decades.\n\nThis is a comedy trope to put the character in a frustraring situation and show how determined (or dumb) they are for being willing to withstand the wait. Sometimes you can see someone else that has already been waiting. If they have been lucky they might need a shave, if they aren't, they won't need a shave...ever again.\n\nSupertrope of Ridiculously Long Phone Hold, Right on Queue, and Take a Number. Compare Ticket-Line Campout, when the character subjects themselves to an excruciating wait for another benefit, normally simply being first. See also The Bore, when a character is wasting someone else's time by speaking too much.
