{"title": "Wealthy Philanthropist", "content": "Rich people in fiction come in many shapes. Wealthy Philanthropists are filthy rich, but they are very well aware of their privilege and they know they have been extremely lucky in life. In addition, they are not ignorant of other people whose lot in life is considerably worse. To balance social injustices, they try to use their money to help the poor and other people who are in need. They can help local people with whom they might (almost) interact, or they may be involved in various charity projects, or they may even start huge foundations or charity organizations. Some of the actions might be done anonymously. Why do they do it? Good Feels Good.\n\nBeing a philanthropist who does much good serves as a characterization device to show that the character has a heart, and to further develop the character as a decent human being and worthy member of the society. It might be apparent right from the start of the story, or it could be revealed as their Hidden Heart of Gold.\n\nThis character trope can also be to used to show that the donor is only doing it for power or fame. It can result in Screw the Rules, I Have Money!, where they threaten to stop donating if they do not get their way. This can also be used by villain characters to become a Villain with Good Publicity\n\nA Wealthy Philanthropist is likely to be Non-Idle Rich and related to Royals Who Actually Do Something. They are equally likely to be a Self-Made Man or come from Old Money. When one of these is a member of The Team, they're The Team Benefactor.\n\nCompare to Uncle Pennybags who is incredibly wealthy and uses his money to help people as well, but he usually focuses on having fun. He is also more likely to spend the money together with those he has enriched.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WealthyPhilanthropist", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Runaways2017", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emma", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/MarvelUniverse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/IronMan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Circles", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ForrestGump", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheAvengers2012", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WithinOurGates", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Hysteria", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Emma", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/PrideAndPrejudice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCountOfMonteCristo", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TwentyThousandLeaguesUnderTheSea", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/JaneEyre", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/RoyalPains", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/House", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CSINY", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePinkertons", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePhilanthropist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Everwood", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FamilyLaw", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JuliesGreenroom", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/Netflix", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JulieAndrews", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CarolBurnett", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMentalist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheGoodPlace", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SchittsCreek", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/UnwindersTallComics", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JKRowling"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFeelsGood", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenHeartOfGold", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainWithGoodPublicity", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NonIdleRich", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoyalsWhoActuallyDoSomething", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfMadeMan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OldMoney", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeam", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeamBenefactor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnclePennybags", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StatusQuoIsGod", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecretIdentity", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CrimeConcealingHobby", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesperatelyLookingForAPurposeInLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShortRunners", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MillionairePlayboy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Nigeria", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoodFeelsGood", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoldDigger", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StiffUpperLip", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NobleDemon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebVideo/TheVictorianWay", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/books/news/article.cfm?c_id=134&objectid=10791515", "http://www.nga.gov/ginfo/aboutnga.shtm", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GlorySeeker", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheQuest", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GratitudeTropes"]}
