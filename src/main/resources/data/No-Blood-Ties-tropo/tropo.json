{"title": "No Blood Ties", "content": "A society in which parents are not expected to raise their own offspring. As a consequence, few people value, or even acknowledge, parent/child relationships.\n\nIn this set up, loyalty to a society or community will probably be stressed over familial ties. The kids might not even know, or care, who their biological parents are. If they do, their relationship is one of polite deference or vague gratitude (\"Thanks for making me exist\"). There may be surrogates in the form of \"foster parents\", with parenting duties being delegated to a select group of trained and licensed guardians, but this is usually a creche-like setup where the foster carer has more children to tend to than is realistic. As a result, they don't have much time to give each individual child. It's no surprise then, that these caretakers don't tend to inspire much affection or loyalty (although they're almost certainly closer to the kids than their biological parents). Often, their role is basically to make sure the kid doesn't die while getting them to fend for themselves as much as possible. Alternatively, children may be integrated into a state-based boarded education system. If the civilization also sports a post-scarcity economy, children may be issued rights and independence sooner, and be allowed to determine their own habitats and social destinies.\n\nThere's a few ways this scenario can be played. If it's idealistic, and the system turns out well adjusted, independent children, then it's usually seen as a type of Author Appeal. Perhaps the author is suggesting that science, the good of the community and universal kinship should supercede bonds like family.\n\nOccasionally, the author might use this pragmatically. If they have adult characters running around and having adventures, a baby is going to get in the way. So the foster system ensures that the readers know that the character is a mature, responsible adult capable of procreation, but doesn't have to worry where the pram is going to go as they saddle up to defeat The Empire. Often, this character will be a parent when it suits them - they will be present for the child's major life events, revel in their baby's achievements, and acknowledge their relationship, but never actually change a nappy.\n\nOn the other end of the scale, this can be a major symptom of the Dystopia - especially if babies are raised from birth by machines, the military, corrupt Government puppets or in a factory-farm type environment. In this case, the decline of blood ties is related to the dehumanisation of the population, and they become little more than machines/weapons of war/brainwashed Mooks.\n\nThe Free-Love Future by necessity must have this attitude towards their kids, since any given person may have dozens of half-siblings, some of whom they might never have met, and the concept of marriage and the Nuclear Family is non-existent. Also worth noting is that surrogacy and Has Two Mommies/Daddies situations don't count, since they involve a sense of parental loyalty and being \"exclusive\" to a family. Families where parents (or children) work away from home and the other parent, or hired help, look after the children don't count either - they still identify as \"belonging\" to a family.\n\nCompare and contrast Raised by the Community, where this is not the societal norm.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBloodTies", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TowardTheTerra", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ThePromisedNeverland", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Invincible", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AAPessimal", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LogansRun", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AnneMcCaffrey", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TowerAndTheHive", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonridersOfPern", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheGiver", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Barsoom", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/BraveNewWorld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Divergent", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/GulliversTravels", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/IsaacAsimov", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRollingStones", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/ACanticleForLeibowitz", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/KPax", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheCityAndTheStars", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WorldWar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DragonsEgg", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/MCAHogarth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TalesOfTheJokka", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/OctaviaButler", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Patternist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Uglies", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HalfwayHuman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheStarsAreColdToys", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Farscape", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Paranoia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Battletech", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Earthdawn", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MagicTheGathering", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Epyllion", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BlackAndWhite", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/DragonAge", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FireEmblemTellius", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/GuildWars2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Halo", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Homestuck", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/SlightlyDamned", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Unsounded", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Gargoyles", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AvatarTheLastAirbender", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThickerThanWater", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_scarcity", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AuthorAppeal", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheEmpire", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Dystopia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Mooks", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeLoveFuture", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NuclearFamily", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HasTwoMommies", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByTheCommunity", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/AudioPlay/SaintBeast", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmnesiacGod", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/RolePlay/WeAreAllPokemonTrainers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoardingSchool", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreeLoveFuture", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WordOfGod", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImmortalityImmorality", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeWillUseManualLabourInTheFuture", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Utopia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaldenTwo", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneGenderRace", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LadyLand", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PerfectPacifistPeople", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FirstContactTeam", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasticCasteSystem", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HumanAlien", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManchurianAgent", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DesignerBabies", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UterineReplicator", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisedByWolves", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeastMan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeopleOfHairColor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChosenOne", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ParentalSubstitute"]}
