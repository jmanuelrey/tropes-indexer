{"title": "Mermaid Arc Emergence", "content": "Splashing to the surface with style\n\nA character who was underwater (usually a woman with long hair) emerging in a massive splash, bending their spine and throwing their head back in a way that makes all to almost all of their hair flip backward and fling some water droplets from the splash over themselves in an arc, occasionally having their eyes shut and mouth hanging open.\n\nWhile some examples existed before, Princess Ariel from The Little Mermaid is without a doubt THE Trope Codifier. The visual of Ariel striking this pose became one of Ariel's most famous moments and basically guaranteed that it would forever be associated with mermaids. Ironically, when Ariel performed this hair flip/splash combination she wasn't a mermaid. It was when Ariel was turned human for the first time and emerged from the ocean after almost drowning. This is why characters having their eyes shut and mouth hanging open like they're struggling to breathe is often part of this pose, even if it doesn't make much sense like when it's a creature who can breathe air AND water.\n\nThis is not an uncommon pose to see in scenarios involving water for a lot of reasons.\n\u2022 It's a very striking visual that grabs your attention easily, with a character just suddenly emerging from a body of water, and the flying droplets caused by the splash and caught by the hair looking rather sparkly if caught by a light source. A great way to make a character the center of attention in a shot.\n\u2022 It could be used as a way to imply or emphasize that something magical is going on, like a character just transformed in some way or that a character has powers of the \"Making a Splash\" sort, with the water almost seeming to perfectly compliment their movements.\n\u2022 It could be used for dramatic effect, like to show that a character almost drowned or barely escaped from some kind of danger in the water. The abruptness of a character emerging from the water like this could add some nice shock value akin to a Jumpscare.\n\u2022 If it's an older character doing this, it can make an excellent Fanservice pose, often for women but it has been used for other genders as well. Due to the way it's executed, it makes the face visible, the hair looks dynamic, pushes out the chest and rear, and can even show off a character's legs depending on how far out of the water they are. It helps that the general body language of this character caught in an explosion of liquid, spine bent back, head and hair thrown back, eyes shut, gasping for breath can invoke a stereotypical Immodest Orgasm in an elegant and tasteful way as the character in question isn't doing anything that's actually sexual in nature. Occasionally, depending on how much clothing (or lack of) a character is wearing, Censor Shadow will be used, which makes the shot invoke something akin to a Sexy Silhouette. May also be combined with the attention-grabbing aspects to create an In-Universe Distracted by the Sexy moment. Common in scenes involving a Waterfall Shower and/or Skinny Dipping.\n\u2022 It is occasionally used in parodies of works like The Little Mermaid, sometimes with a twist, like the hair not moving as intended or someone using something that isn't their hair (like a beard) or making fun of the Fanservice aspects of this pose by having it be done by a conventionally unattractive character.\n\nThis trope can be subject to Rule of Cool (and/or Rule of Sexy if it's being used for Fanservice) at times, due to how hard it would be to have most of your body rise above deep water like this.\n\nIn the instances where this is played for Fanservice, this counts as a Sub-Trope of Sexy Surfacing Shot for when a character who was subermged underwater gets out of the water in a way that is meant to draw the audience and/or other InUniverse character's attention to their physical attractiveness.\n\nSee also Everything's Better with Sparkles, Hair Flip, Sexy Surfacing Shot and Shaking Her Hair Loose.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MermaidArcEmergence", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/RalphBreaksTheInternet", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/TheLittleMermaid", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/TheLittleMermaid", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/GoPrincessPrettyCure", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/SailorMoonCrystal", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fathom", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Gen13", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Starfire", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RedHoodAndTheOutlaws", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/TheLittleMermaid", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/TheLittleMermaid", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/TheLittleMermaidIIReturnToTheSea", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/RalphBreaksTheInternet", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/WonderWoman2009", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LaraCroftTombRaider", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheScorpionKing", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HartOfDixie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BigCityGreens", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/TheLittleMermaid", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/TheLittleMermaid", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/JusticeLeagueUnlimited", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLittleMermaid", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheFairlyOddParents", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SamuraiJack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StormHawks"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapunzelHair", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySurfacingShot", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithSparkles", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TransformationSequence", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jumpscare", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BuxomisBetter", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShesGotLegs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoesThisRemindYouofAnything", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheImmodestOrgasm", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BarelyThereSwimwear", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkinnyDipping", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CensorShadow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySilhouette", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WaterfallShower", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkinnyDipping", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfCool", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleOfSexy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Fanservice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubTrope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySurfacingShot", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DistractedByTheSexy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingsBetterWithSparkles", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HairFlip", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySurfacingShot", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShakingHerHairLoose", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSAJX8qGebo", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySurfacingShot", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatingTheEyeCandy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerMakesYourHairGrow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySurfacingShot", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MakingASplash", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SkinnyDipping", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShamelessFanserviceGirl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureScene", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActionDressRip", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DressedInLayers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShowerScene", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LandingInSomeonesBathtub", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySurfacingShot", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlowMotion", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatingTheEyeCandy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MatchCut", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CatapultNightmare", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShoutOut", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/JusticeLeagueUnlimitedS3E13Destroyer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SexySurfacingShot", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WreathedInFlames"]}
