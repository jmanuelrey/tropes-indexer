{"title": "Unflappable Guardian", "content": "They always present a polite and kind face, quietly protecting their charges. Can appear dense to others, but these are intelligent characters who note details and quirks and file them away without letting others know they're doing it. They would prefer having the mysterious stranger who showed up in the first episode come live with you, just to find out their real intentions. Or they'll casually suggest you go visit that abandoned field where a ghost is supposed to haunt.\n\nKeeping the peace and serenity of the group and household is what prevents them from outwardly doing things, since they seem the type who could be very dangerous and create chaos if they wanted to. Anyone pointing this out (usually a villain or very smart character) will be met with a pleasant and suspicious dismissal.\n\nVery commonly a character's mother or grandparent, this often overlaps with the Harem Nanny. Compare Silk Hiding Steel for a similar pleasant-yet-powerful personality and indeed this trope may be their role in the household.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnflappableGuardian", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/HappyWorld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TenchiMuyo", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FruitsBasket", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/Yumeria", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/Kanon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/RanmaOneHalf", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DeathNote", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/MariaHolic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Bleach", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/DaaDaaDaa", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/ParadiseKiss", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Sekirei", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/ImGonnaBeAnAngel", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RichardDragonKungFuFighter", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/RichardDragon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoomins"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SecondEpisodeMorning", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HaremNanny", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilkHidingSteel", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicalGirlfriend", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObfuscatingStupidity", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AGodAmI", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheProtagonist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeamMom", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EveryoneCallsHimBarkeep"]}
