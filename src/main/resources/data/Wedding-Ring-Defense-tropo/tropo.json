{"title": "Wedding Ring Defense", "content": "To many people, random sex with a married person note who isn't their spouse is a line they don't want to cross. Even The Casanova may back down if he realizes his current target is married.\n\nThis trope is when an unmarried person (often female) invokes that reaction by wearing a gold ring on his or her left ring finger. While technically a lie, this trope doesn't automatically include these characters being generally dishonest. Their desire to not have to put up with others assuming they're sexually available normally gets sympathy, or at least understanding.\n\nRelated to Seduction-Proof Marriage, as the decoy ring is meant to tell observers that the character is in this type of relationship. The observer may also see the ring as a sign that she is \"taken\" by another male, and must be left alone unless he wants to challenge that male. Of course, it doesn't always work \u2014 some see a person with a wedding/engagement ring as a \"challenge\".\n\nA common, usually-male, inversion is wearing a wedding ring to attract interest. It's part of the phenomenon known as \"preselection\" or \"social proof,\" in which some women, upon observing evidence that another woman or women are attracted to a man (and a wedding ring certainly counts as evidence), will subconsciously find him more attractive as well. Compare Magnetic Girlfriend.\n\nIf a married person takes off their wedding ring because they're intending to have an affair with someone, that falls under Wedding Ring Removal.\n\nVery much Truth in Television, in fact a common recommendation for single women in the work force is to buy a plain gold band if they don't already have one.\n\nA False Widow probably has the ring, but may or may not be using it to dodge male interest. (There's a reason we have Romancing the Widow as a trope, after all.)
