Loose Lips sink ships \u2014 and where will you find looser lips than in the midst of centers of socialization and self-indulgence such as beauty parlors, barber shops, nail salons or massage parlors? People assume that the help is being paid for their discretion. But maybe they're only pretending to be a sympathetic ear about that project you're working on at work. Or maybe that fellow customer is just pretending to be waiting for the next empty styling chair as cover for hours of listening. Failing that, trapping some VIP (or their significant other or faithful subordinate) under the hairdryer or at the shampoo basin gives one an excellent opportunity to rifle through their purses or coat pockets...\n\nIn more fantastic settings, out-and-out mind-reading might be involved, making spas particularly useful for psychics who need proximity or touch in order to read minds. For more aggressive intelligence operatives, this may lead to Sauna of Death.\n\u2022 In Like Flint. The Fabulous Face beauty spa uses special hairdryers to brainwash their female clients into becoming ardent feminists. It then uses them as spies for the organization.\n\u2022 A more mundane instance in one Encyclopedia Brown case, where a customer nabbed an important secret from the owners because they thought she couldn't hear them under the hairdryer. Turned out she was deaf to begin with, and read their lips.\n\u2022 The finale to Batman had special guest villainess Zsa Zsa Gabor reading billionaire spa-goers' minds with her special \"Eggplant Jelly Vitamin Scalp Massage\".\n\u2022 The Bionic Woman: In \"Brain Wash\", Oscar's secretary Peggy Callahan falls victim to a spa with hidden tape recorders and Truth Serum-laced shampoo. For extra points, the guy running the salon is her fianc\u00e9.\n\u2022 Burn Notice: In \"Hard Bargain\", Michael poses as a hostage negotiator trying to rescue a kidnapped girl. The leader of the kidnapping ring, Reyes, meets him in a massage parlor, which Michael tells him is smart, because it means Reyes knows Michael isn't wearing a wire (or anything besides a towel, for that matter). After Reyes leaves, Mike asks the masseuse if they paid her for the whole hour.\n\u2022 Wonder Woman (1975): The episode \"I Do, I Do\" features a spa with mind-reading massages, which the proprietor uses to gain classified information from .\n\u2022 In the Ars Magica adventure \"The Sorcerer's Slave\", Byzantium's famous Baths of Zeuxippus are secretly run by an amoral, ambitious mage who spies on the guests for useful information. He's aided in this by an invisible water spirit who can manipulate emotions and read minds. In addition, the Player Characters are expected to disrobe like every other guest, making it quite difficult to keep hidden weapons or equipment.\n\u2022 Vampire: The Masquerade \u0096 Bloodlines: The Lotus Blossom spa and massage parlour is a front for the local Tong gang (and, therefore, for ).

Before attending a meeting, clothes and weapons are stowed in cubbies in a separate room.

Connie at first refers to Varanasi as Azkendaren's \"resident Rajland spy\" before correcting herself with \"trade magnate.\" She is charged with absconding a MacGuffin from a covert Kahn force operating in the city's Forbidden Zone. Notably, the sauna is chosen to preclude weapons, yet Connie can produce a blade as if from Hammerspace.
