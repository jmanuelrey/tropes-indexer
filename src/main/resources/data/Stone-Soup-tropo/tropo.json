{"title": "Stone Soup", "content": "A tactic whereby a character acts in a manner that can be perceived as eccentric or insane, in order to prompt other, bickering, characters into cooperation. This usually happens because of shared concern for the welfare of the first character, or a joint desire to \"not upset the crazy person.\" When it works, it results in An Aesop about cooperation and conflict resolution.\n\nNamed for the classic folk tale in which a strange wanderer breezes into town and offers everyone a free bowl of his remarkable stone soup (made by putting his soupstone \u2014 a seemingly ordinary rock \u2014 into a pot of water and boiling it). The suspicious villagers have hidden their food, but the stranger slowly persuades them to add it to the pot, a little at a time, until at last they have contributed all the potatoes, onions, garlic, carrots, beef, turnips, parsley, salt, pepper, tomatoes, and bread to make a real meal.\n\nThis story tends to be played for An Aesop, but the moral varies depending on how the teller wants to spin the tale. In one version, the villagers realize that cooperation is better than competition and suspicion; they have enough food among them to feed everyone a good meal, if they share it. In another (far more cynical) version, the stranger is playing a well-rehearsed Con Game: blinded by the promise of \"free\" food, the villagers never catch on and ultimately spend all their money to buy the stranger's magical soup stone, becoming victims of their own greed. In this case, the Aesop is more like \"If it sounds Too Good to Be True, it probably is.\"\n\nFor the comic strip, see here.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StoneSoup", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/WaltDisney", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ArchieComics", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Fables", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DungeonsAndDragons", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PiratesOfTheCaribbeanAtWorldsEnd", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertAHeinlein", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MethuselahsChildren", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheMoonIsAHarshMistress", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/TheHitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheRestaurantAtTheEndOfTheUniverse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/GordonRDickson", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LandOfTheLost", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LittleHouseOnThePrairie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/JimHenson", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheStoryteller"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TricksterMentor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EatDirtCheap", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnAesop", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfIdealismVersusCynicism", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConMan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TooGoodToBeTrue", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FencePainting", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BavarianFireDrill", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/StoneSoup", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarthAllAlong", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Atlantis", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PHoward", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BookDumb", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Aesop", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SubvertedTrope"]}
