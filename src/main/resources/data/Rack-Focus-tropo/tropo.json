{"title": "Rack Focus", "content": "You know what would fix this? Bifocals.\n\nChanging the point of focus from one character or object in frame, to another character or object that is closer to or more distant from the camera, typically with little or no movement from the camera itself. Used to subtly direct the viewers' attention to a specific part of the screen.\n\nAlternatively called \"Roll Focus\" or, in film, \"Pull Focus\". Requires deft manipulation of the Depth of Field.\n\nIn motion picture and film-based television production, this is often done by a separate person (the \"focus puller\" or \"first camera assistant\") rather than by the primary camera operator. In video production, the cameras usually aren't large enough for this to be necessary, and on consumer-level gear, it might not even be possible because of the way autofocus is usually implemented. note Now that video-equipped DSLRs (originally designed for newspaper photographers creating web content) have made inexpensive, near-film-quality video a reality for all but No Budget directors, rack focus is something nearly any camera operator can do, but it requires either a very steady hand (and tripod), a pile of expensive Hollywood-style equipment (the big guys are starting to use DSLRs too), or a software hack like Magic Lantern that can automate the process by taking over the camera's autofocus mechanism. Needless to say, like every other pro trick that amateurs pick up, it can be horribly misused, and as DSLRs and their smaller EVIL brethren become cheaper and more popular, it probably will be.\n\nSometimes used in two-dimensional animation, which involves filming the foreground and background separately and then combining them.\n\nIn theory Rack Focus should be made redundant in new 3D films because the viewer would be able to change focus at will. Of course because it is a simulation of 3D this isn't quite true and the technique remains. This sometimes causes frustration as the viewer wants to change focus but cannot.\n\nIf you were expecting a trope about shots focusing on women's racks, see Male Gaze.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RackFocus", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LindseyStirling", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Hanayamata", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/TheLionKing", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Up", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/LegendOfTheGuardiansTheOwlsOfGaHoole", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory3", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ToyStory2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AGoofyMovie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/BigHero6", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Avatar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HarryPotterAndThePhilosophersStone", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MasterAndCommander", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/WhoFramedRogerRabbit", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheHobbit", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Glee", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/LindseyStirling", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GameOfThrones", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/AlienIsolation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/DextersLaboratory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TomAndJerry", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/WhosAfraidOfVirginiaWoolf"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DepthOfField", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoBudget", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/ThreeDMovie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/JustForFun/IThoughtItMeant", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MaleGaze", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MisplacedWildlife", "http://youtu.be/x8RKCmkOyB4", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeyWait", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RackFocus", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EurekaMoment", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupernaturalS02E22AllHellBreaksLoosePartTwo", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oNpmSAvpGQ", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyDetectingRadar", "http://www.egscomics.com/?date=2009-08-26", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/TeamFortress2", "http://www.teamfortress.com/tf05_old_wounds/#f=20", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E3LessonZero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E19PuttingYourHoofDown", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WantedPoster", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheTeaser", "http://lytro.com"]}
