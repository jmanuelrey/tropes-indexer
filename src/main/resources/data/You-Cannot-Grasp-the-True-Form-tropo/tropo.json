{"title": "You Cannot Grasp the True Form", "content": "And in those utter voids, even these little shadows have an influence, the edge of this void starts piling up with these invented things that aren't real, but seem real enough to manifest, and they merge together. The more people know of this void and subconsciously overwrite it with their own patterns, the more they are. And if there's too much of this thought together, too many of these inventions of the mind piling up at the edge of nothingness, they start to merge into one thing, it becomes complex, gains a sentience, and realizes what it actually is. It exists now, and it would very much like to go back to not existing. That little thing is what's known as a Pattern Screamer , because it's born from seeing nonexistant patterns, and it screams in hatred of thought that brought it to be. And the only way to erase it is to erase the inventions that made it happen; the only way to make that happen is to send the ones who thought them into this nothingness, so they'll stop existing. The threshold is around ten people; any more than that knowing of this void, and the screaming starts", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCanNotGraspTheTrueForm", "media_links": [], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination"]}
