{"title": "Visual Development", "content": "You've missed a few episodes of a show you are watching. Shouldn't be a big deal...wait, when did Alice grow her hair out? And why did Bob shave his beard?

In real life, people who go through dramatic changes do sometimes change their appearance.

The connection may not be made clear, but the visual change coincides with the emotional change.\n\nThis trope is very useful in Long-Runners, as it allows for the fanbase to differentiate between major arcs by the visual differences.

In later seasons, after he Took a Level in Badass, he tended to wear the Peacekeeper leathers, which look frickin' awesome. Later, he upgraded to a Badass Longcoat.\n\u2022 Setsuka from the Soul Series (making her debut in SoulCalibur III) is a woman of European descent who was adopted by a Japanese master and taught to live like any normal Japanese girl from the 16th century. Shunned for being a foreigner, Setsuka dyed her blond hair black to fit in better (this could be discerned only if the player chose Setsuka's 2P costume in III). However, in IV, Setsuka completely ditches the hair dye in both outfits and reverts back to her natural hair color.\n\u2022 In Dragon Age II, Merrill's armor changes from black-and-green to white-and-red upon completion of her Romance Sidequest.\n\u2022 Commander Shepard's unhealed scars in Mass Effect 2 will become more prominent if s/he follows the Renegade path but heal almost completely if s/he is a Paragon.\n\u2022 In the Fable series, your appearance changed according to your morality.
