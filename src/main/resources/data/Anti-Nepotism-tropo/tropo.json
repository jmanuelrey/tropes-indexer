{"title": "Anti-Nepotism", "content": "Nepotism is a longstanding practice whereby people with personal connections to authority figures are elevated in position regardless of, and often despite, their actual level of competence. The practice is so well-known, and so commonly hated as a form of corruption, that some honest authority figures have been known to swing too far the other direction to avoid any possible appearance that they might be unduly favoring their own kin and friends.\n\nWhile on the one level Anti-Nepotism generally shows the practicer's bonafides as a Reasonable Authority Figure and/or Honest Corporate Executive, it's hard on the people on the receiving end. They may feel their own ambitions are being stifled by their powerful relative, breeding resentment. Or they may become increasingly desperate to please the relative and take greater and more dangerous risks. Or it might just be fodder for grumbling to their friends but not significantly affect their personal relationship to their powerful relative.\n\nA Defied Trope form of Nepotism.
