{"title": "Political Strategy Game", "content": "Owing to the Strategy Games' historical origins in War Gaming, most of them revolve around territorial or resource conflict, even when combat is not the sole focus (e.g. in settlement Simulation Games and 4X). By contrast, games that simulate political conflict over influence and/or ideology (usually in the context of an occidental liberal-capitalist democracy) are few and far in-between, with two subgenres generally distinguished: in an Electoral Game, players engage in political battle to come to power (whether through election or revolution), while in a Legislative Game, they already are in power and negotiate policies and spin intrigues to remain there. Both kinds typically have following gameplay features:\n\u2022 Political Ideologies are a form of Character Alignment and/or Karma Meter comprised of (often contradictory) scoring criteria, usually affecting either how many resources (see below) the player gets or how close they are to winning (or both). Because most political strategies take place in Western(-inspired) settings, specific ideologies are typically based on existing and historical Western political movements.\n\u2022 Popular support is a indicator of how much sway a given player holds within the simulated constituency. It has different gameplay functions in Electoral and Legislative Games: the former usually tie it to the victory condition (the player with the most support wins), while in the latter, they function more like Hit Points (if your support drops below certain threshold as a result of your or other players' actions, you lose).\n\u2022 Political capital are resources that the players spend to enact their political agenda. Some games have only one generic resource, while others subdivide it into multiple types, with different in-game actions requiring different amounts of different resources. Most common resource types are Money (material resource) and Clout (immaterial); sometimes, Force (training and equipment needed for direct, violent action) and Media (control over information itself) are distinguished, as well. Different resource types may be associated with particular ideologies, e.g. in how you obtain them or which flavor of actions you can spend them on.\n\u2022 Political actions are the main Gameplay Mechanic available to players:\n\u2022 The core mechanic in Electoral Games is spending political capital to acquire popular support, whereas in Legislative Games, capital is spent on proposing, backing, and opposing new policies.\n\u2022 Additionally, both genres typically feature a large number of strongly-themed special actions, which can be used to give oneself extra resources, to sabotage other players' support or resources, or even to knock them out of the game entirely.\n\u2022 In games with hidden information, one may carry out special actions in secret, allowing other players to spend resources to investigate them, in hopes of exposing one's wrongdoing and damaging one's popular support.\n\u2022 Current issues are a form of Random Events designed to challenge the players' in-game ideology, ideally by pitting it against their pressing practical concerns (or against other players'). Taking a stance on a current issue (in word or in deed) typically results in the player's political capital and/or popular support shifting up or down, depending on the specific design.\n\u2022 In multiplayer games, players are typically allowed to trade political capital at any point, but not ideology (however it is modeled in the game) or popular support. Furthermore, they are fully expected to form temporary coalitions, which may or may not have special mechanics attached to them, so political strategy typically sits in the Dynamic Alliances section of the Sliding Scale of Cooperation vs. Competition. Combined with ideologies-as-alignments, this usually facilitates some amount of role-playing among players.\n\nUltimately, political strategies are about managing the conflict of interest: your power (resource) comes from representing the interests of others, whether they are individual voter demographics, special interests like domestic lobbies and foreign NGOs, or rival players, all of whom impose contradictory restrictions on how you can spend that power. The tension comes from maneuvering around these restrictions to maintain existing support while also expanding it.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliticalStrategyGame", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Reddit", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Clout", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheCampaignTrail", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/RepublicOfRome", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/ThePartisans", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Kickstarter", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/SHASN", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Tropico", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/RepublicTheRevolution", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Democracy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/ParadoxInteractive", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/VictoriaAnEmpireUnderTheSun", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/CrusaderKings", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Stellaris"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrategyGame", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarGaming", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimulationGame", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FourX", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PoliticalIdeologies", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElectionDayEpisode", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PoliticalIdeologies", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterAlignment", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KarmaMeter", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VariablePlayerGoals", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HitPoints", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLoseAtZeroTrust", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ResourcesManagementGameplay", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveMoney", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScrewTheRulesIHaveConnections", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppealToForce", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilUnrestTropes", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropagandaMachine", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawmanNewsMedia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameMechanics", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpecialAttack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CorruptPolitician", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AttackOfThePoliticalAd", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssassinationAttempt", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnemyScan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Scandalgate", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CounterAttack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEvent", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfCooperationVsCompetition", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TabletopRPG", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Roleplay/ModelUSGov", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForumRolePlays", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IGaveMyWord", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attic_talent", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/JuliusCaesar", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equites", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RabbleRouser", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryCoup", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentForLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEvent", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/ExtraCredits", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1225737959/the-partisans-an-extra-politics-extra-credits-game/description", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/PoliticalIdeologies", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/IndianLanguages", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zainmemon/shasn-the-political-strategy-board-game-break-ks/description", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/TheRomanRepublic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwentyMinutesIntoTheFuture", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering", "https://www.atariarchives.org/bigcomputergames/showpage.php?page=47", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OlderThanTheNES", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-in_program", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Atari2600", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdiosyncraticDifficultyLevels", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/AmericanPoliticalSystem", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEvent", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SimulationGame", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BananaRepublic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnstableEquilibrium", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/HoleInFlag", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeoplesRepublicOfTyranny", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClassAndLevelSystem", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlignmentBasedEndings", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MilitaryCoup", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VelvetRevolution", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PresidentEvil", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlaveToPR", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SignatureStyle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/Venice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MerchantPrince", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RelationshipValues", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEvent", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArrangedMarriage", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouLoseAtZeroTrust", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiveMind", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtificialIntelligence", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheFederation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DemocracyIsBad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheXenophile", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AbsoluteXenophobe", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Pacifist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WarIsGlorious", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OutgrownSuchSillySuperstitions", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReligionIsRight"]}
