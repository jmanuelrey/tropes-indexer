{"title": "Stolen by Staying Still", "content": "Sometimes, despite a thief's best efforts, an object will just be too difficult to steal. In such cases, the next best thing is to convince everybody that it has been stolen by making it appear to vanish when, in fact, it has not gone anywhere at all.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why this might be done. Sometimes, especially if the object is symbolic in some fashion, making everyone believe it has been stolen is just effective as actually stealing it. At other times, making people think it has been stolen will cause the security measures to be disabled to allow an investigation to occur, and the thief plans to really steal the item once this happens.\n\nThe Phantom Thief tends to do this, by way of their Stage Magician tricks.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StolenByStayingStill", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NaokiUrasawa", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Batman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/NowYouSeeMe", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SherlockHolmesInNewYork", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/LastSonOfKrypton", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/LexLuthor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/NickVelvet", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Banacek", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Hustle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JonathanCreek", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Leverage", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/FatherBrown", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMagician", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheInBESTigators", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Fillmore"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PhantomThief", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StageMagician", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiddenInPlainSight", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EffectiveKnockoff", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BeatBag", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Discworld/TheFifthElephant", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Discworld/Thud", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeNeedADistraction"]}
