{"title": "Instant Emergency Response", "content": "So there's been a major fire, car crash, robbery, heart attack, or other catastrophe. Isn't it amazing how the police, firefighters, or EMTs show up really quickly, often in a matter of seconds? Sometimes, you don't even have to call 911!\n\nIf only it worked like that in Real Life. It usually takes around 5-10 minutes for the emergency responders to arrive, and even then, it often takes a while before they can actually do anything. For example, when firefighters arrive at a fire, it usually takes around 5 minutes from the time of arrival before they can actually start spraying water on the fire. This is one of the reasons why real estate near major hospitals is so expensive: you get a much quicker reaction time, obviously. It's also why living next to a fire station makes your homeowner's or renter's insurance far lower at least for fire coverage, and unlike in the hospital example, fire station real estate generally doesn't cost more in money - due to the (in urban areas) near-continual noise.\n\nIf you live in a rural area (or a very busy urban one) add even more time to that response - long drives to spread-out rural areasnote Not always true \u2014 in the U.K., all emergency services have to be able to reach any area of the nation in 8 minutes or less by law. This leads to a lot of small communities where most of the buildings are police, fire, and ambulance depots so they can fulfill this, or alternately trying to get through heavy traffic/dealing with lots of other problems in a busy urban area can lead to response times up to 20-30 minutes even for the most dire emergencies. Disaster situations and situations where there's a large emergency or lots of small but important emergencies even if it/they isn't bad enough to be classified as a \"disaster\" are even worse - there, you may not get anything in an hour or more - if at all.\n\nIn short, a very good reason to follow good crime prevention practices such as making property more difficult to enter, and to learn basic first aid and firefighting/fire evacuation skills - and a contentious issue in the US gun control debate, which we will not go into here aside from saying that the decision to be armed or not as preparedness is very personal, very individual, and so highly emotional that it is best not discussed on this page.\n\nNote: Cases where it's explicitly mentioned that an ambulance or fire truck simply happened to be nearby (known to emergency responders as a \"running call\") fit better under Contrived Coincidence.\n\nCompare/contrast Ambulance Cut, where there's a quick cut from the emergency to the response, usually for laughs. Contrast Police are Useless, where police assistance is late and doesn't do any good when it finally does arrive.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InstantEmergencyResponse", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/IronMan2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheTakingOfPelhamOneTwoThree", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Heat", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ClerksII", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/LastActionHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ReservoirDogs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/AmericanHistoryX", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/ABronxTale", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/SupermanTheMovie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheRoom", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/PhoneBooth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DemolitionMan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Clue", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/RobertRankin", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheDresdenFiles", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SixteenThirtyTwo", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThePromise2011", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dollhouse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrderSVU", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BuffyTheVampireSlayer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Thunderbirds", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Firefly", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Emergency", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/KamenRiderBlack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SeventhHeaven", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BoyMeetsWorld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Elementary", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Rescue911", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ChicagoFire", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyHatesChris", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/APB", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/OnlyFoolsAndHorses", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Cyberpunk", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Shadowrun", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/D20Modern", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Payday2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheRenAndStimpyShow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Futurama", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RegularShow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SouthPark", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HomeMovies"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/RuleOfCautiousEditingJudgment", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ContrivedCoincidence", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbulanceCut", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayedForLaughs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TragicHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForegoneConclusion", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WelcomeToTheRealWorld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/BritishPubs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterTitle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstructed", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PrisonEpisode", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SupernaturalS02E19FolsomPrisonBlues", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBdJfsN_aps", "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDOmwjgKBcI&feature=related", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExaggeratedTrope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SWATTeam", "http://egscomics.com/comic/2016-02-10", "http://egscomics.com/comic/2016-02-15", "http://egscomics.com/comic/2016-02-22", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderBender", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FelonyMisdemeanor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/KilroyWasHere", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MustHaveCaffeine", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EMTs", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LeParkour", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless"]}
