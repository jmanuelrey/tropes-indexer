{"title": "Inconvenient Darkroom Illumination", "content": "A classic scene in a lot of media where film is used for a photograph; a photographer is in a darkroom developing the print, when suddenly someone opens the door, turns on the lights, or activates some other light source, bathing the room in bright light and overexposing the print, rendering the photograph entirely black.\n\nThis always happens before the print has been put into the fixer, as the image is destroyed completely. The main part here is that the photo is then worthless and either cannot be saved, or requires lots of technology to recover. Naturally, this tends to happen especially if the photo in question is of extreme importance, or of something so unique that it can not be recreated.\n\nMostly this happens on accident, but a character can do it on purpose if he or she wants to destroy the photo for some reason.\n\nCan be Truth in Television, but not as much as fiction would like you to believe. In Real Life, to print an image requires the negative to be developed and fixed, and thus rendered insensitive to light. In other words, only if this trope happens before the photographer has the chance to fix the negative will you get an all black photograph. A print that was developed and then exposed to light will turn pink or redish, and if it's further developed after fogging it becomes a solarized print, not a piece of solid black paper. Film doesn't show much effect if it's briefly fogged in between development and fixing. Finally, as the negative was able to be printed from, even if a print is destroyed, you can make as many prints as you want.\n\nNowadays becoming a Dead Horse Trope due to digital photography, which no longer requires darkrooms and a delicate developing process. And before that, an instant camera with self-developing film could already be used to avoid this problem.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InconvenientDarkroomIllumination", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePinkPanther", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/DisneyDucksComicUniverse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheGreatMuppetCaper", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/GhostbustersII", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/IAmNumberFour", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GetSmart", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JustShootMe", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/SuddenlySusan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/BettyWhite", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/GilligansIsland", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/HogansHeroes", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StrangerThings", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BabylonBerlin", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/HenryStickminSeries", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ColossalCave", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/CodeLyoko", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/ThePinkPanther", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheSimpsons", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/GravityFalls", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheLoudHouse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheepInTheBigCity"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OhCrap", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TruthInTelevision", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadHorseTrope", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BerserkButton", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NightmareFace", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicStrip/TheFarSide", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PottyDance", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerIncontinence", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SilentFilm", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunishmentBox", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RunningGag", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UpToEleven", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpringTimeForHitler", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HiccupHijinks", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/TheSimpsonsS19E13TheDebarted", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FlyingSaucer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockNessMonster", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElvisLives", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FrameUp", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClearMyName", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LiteralMinded", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffBlowingUp"]}
