I mean, you don't call someone racist when he owns a coffin that can make his girlfriend black. \" \"'SUPERMAN SAYS:CAN SLAP A JAP' might be the most famous racist comic panel of all time. It's included in nearly every discussion of WWII propaganda and is found on Mel Gibson 's computer in the folder 'Tattoo Ideas.' But to Superman's credit, he was probably trying to stop that printing press. Superman never\n\nThe term wartime cartoon refers primarily to cartoons made or released in The Golden Age of Animation during World War II and having some specific reference to the war effort. Many wartimes are explicit propaganda, while others make humorous jabs at conditions on the home front such as the rationing of fuels, materials and consumer goods, and even meat.\n\nWhile some wartimes have remained popular as period pieces, many of these are now considered controversial due to the caricatural depictions of Germans and (especially) Japanese (see Those Wacky Nazis and Yellow Peril, respectively). Of course, with The Holocaust now common knowledge, it's interesting how the racial policies of the Nazis were relatively rarely dwelt upon in those cartoons. So imagine the shock of the general public when the Final Solution death camps were discovered and their realization that, no matter what awful things the Allied propaganda might have claimed about them up to then, Those Wacky Nazis were actually worse, with them committing acts of villainy that beggared the worst of nightmares.\n\nTypical trademarks of these cartoons that are usually spoofed: propaganda elements, racist caricatures, outdated references to the war effort (i.e., Shout Outs to save scrap iron, conserve gasoline, buy war bonds, or grow a Victory Garden). Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and/or Emperor Hirohito often make a cameo and are ridiculed.\n\u2022 In The Simpsons episode Itchy and Scratchy The Movie Itchy & Scratchy did a wartime cartoon where they team up (briefly) to kill Hitler. After chopping Hitler's head off, Itchy does the same to Scratchy. On top of that, FDR runs in and kicks both Hitler and Scratchy in the butt while Itchy holds a sign, \"Save Scrap Iron\".\n\u2022 An \"X-Presidents\" cartoon on Saturday Night Live parodied these, as the titular former president superheroes tried to get Spongebob Squarepants to make a cartoon supporting the war in Iraq. Spongebob wasn't interested, and things turned ugly.\n\u2022 South Park paid homage to wartime cartoons in \"Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants\", where Cartman bamboozles Osama bin Laden a la Bugs Bunny while the other boys escape from the terrorist leader's lair.\n\u2022 Another episode features Cartman asking Santa Claus to bring Christmas to Iraq and they end up shooting him down and kidnapping him, so it's up to the boys and Jesus to rescue him. The ending features Jesus and Santa blowing away many terrorists with machine guns, but Jesus ends up sacrificing himself so they can escape and to save time Santa turns the terrorists' weapons into toys and candy so they can't shoot them down.\n\u2022 Part 1 of \"Imaginationland\" features terrorists invading Imaginationland and killing many fictional characters. They use a rocket character to release the evil characters, getting killed themselves in the process.\n\u2022 \"I'm a Little Bit Country\", which looks at protest over the war in Iraq. Turns out the answer is to go to war and then protest against it.\n\u2022 Family Guy has Osama Bin Laden making a fool of himself while trying to record a death threat. Stewie eventually shows up and kicks his ass, before blowing up his cave and escaping back to Quahog. The whole thing doubles as a send-up of the openings to the The Naked Gun movies.\n\u2022 Another memorable bit has a suicide bomber asking his handlers what he's going to do afterwards, and their (failed) attempts to explain the concept to him.\n\u2022 A suicide bomber gets to heaven and tries to cash in on his promise of seventy-some-odd virgins. He's shown a huge group of comic book and gaming nerds playing Magic: The Gathering, much to his dismay.\n\u2022 The pre-9/11 episode \"Road to Rhode Island\" has Stewie distracting the guards at an airport security check by singing and dancing so that his bag (full of weapons) goes through the x-ray undetected. Upon picking it up, he says \"Let's hope Osama Bin Laden doesn't know showtunes!\" As he walks away, Osama shows up using the same technique. The Osama scene is cut from the later airings and the Volume 1 DVD, but is intact on the \"Freakin' Sweet Collection\" DVD.\n\u2022 Animaniacs did a short with the Warner Siblings that would have fit right in with the actual shorts above, which focused on recycling for the war effort. With all the zany gags that implies.\n\u2022 An episode during the First Gulf War had Yakko, Wakko, and Slappy antagonizing Saddam Hussein. Slappy: And I'm Princess Angelina Contessa Luisa Francesca... here, have some dynamite down yer pants. Aw, forget it: here, have some dynamite down yer pants.\n\u2022 A later episode, in which the Warners accidentally arrive in Hell trying to go to the Six Flags at Flushing Meadows, begins with Saddam Hussein being sent there via trapdoor and tormented by Satan and his minions.\n\u2022 There was also a short with Rita and Runt that takes place during the Nazi invasion of Poland, where Rita and Runt keep the Nazi's dog, Schnappsi (who happens to be Newt from the Minerva Mink shorts), and the Nazis themselves, from finding a Polish girl and her father and taking them to a concentration camp.\n\u2022 A Goodfeathers episode, \"Dough Dough Boys,\" has Bobby, Pesto, and Squit as messenger pigeons during WWI.\n\u2022 Freedom Force, being a big tribute to comics of the era, naturally has this in spades.\n\u2022 City of Heroes likewise has quite a few tributes. Much of the backstory involves the major heroes and villains fighting in WWII, and the trailer includes a hero throwing a Nazi tank. The game even has a Nazi villain group, the 5th Column, which players can fight against.\n\u2022 An episode of Histeria! based on World War II had a skit with the leaders of the Allied Forces as a band of superheroes called \"The Freedom League\".\n\u2022 Epic Mickey, while not being an homage per se, draws quite a bit of its imagery from this kind of cartoons. And by \"a bit\", we mean an entire race of NPCs.\n\u2022 A chilling moment from the movie The Rocketeer had Howard Hughes show Cliff Secord a Nazi propaganda cartoon showing squadrons of jetpack-wearing Nazis as the vanguard of an invasion force against America. Especially chilling considering that the movie was a Disney Studios production!\n\u2022 Casey and Andy has this .\n\u2022 Fallout 4 has seven \"What Makes You S.P.E.C.I.A.L.?\" videos aimed to explain the game's skill system to new players. In-universe, they're propaganda cartoons produced by Vault-Tec to help the population prepare for a nuclear apocalypse (although the writers at Vault-Tec would have had to be pretty prescient to know that people and animals would mutate from radiation exposure, and that caps would become the main form of currency - among other things).\n\u2022 North Korean animation follows this Trope , only in the modern day and the enemy is the United States. Propaganda surely knows no country.\n\u2022 The Armenian-made cartoons are a modern example pertaining to the Nagorno-Karabakh War (caution: they're likely to offend you if you're from Azerbaijan).",
