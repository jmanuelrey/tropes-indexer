{"title": "Long List", "content": "\"I can believe that things are true and I can believe things that aren\u0092t true and I can believe things where nobody knows if they\u0092re true or not. I can believe in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny and Marilyn Monroe and the Beatles and Elvis and Mister Ed. Listen \u0096 I believe that people are perfectible, that knowledge is infinite, that the world is run by secret banking cartels and is visited by aliens on a regular basis, nice ones that look like wrinkledy lemurs and bad ones who mutilate cattle and want our water and our women. I believe that the future sucks and I believe that future rocks and I believe that one day White Buffalo Woman is going to come back and kick everyone\u0092s ass. I believe that all men are just overgrown boys with deep problems communicating and that the decline in good sex in America is coincident with the decline in drive-in movie theaters from state to state. I believe that all politicians are unprincipled crooks and I still believe that they are better than the alternative. I believe that California is going to sink into the sea when the big one comes, while Florida is going to dissolve into madness and alligators and toxic waste. I believe that antibacterial soap is destroying our resistance to dirt and disease so that one day we\u0092ll all be wiped out by the common cold like the Martians in War of the Worlds. I believe that the greatest poets of the last century were Edith Sitwell and Don Marquis, that jade is dried dragon sperm, and that thousands of years ago in a former life I was a one-armed Siberian shaman. I believe that mankind\u0092s destiny lies in the stars. I believe that candy really did taste better when I was a kid, that it\u0092s aerodynamically impossible for a bumblebee to fly, that light is a wave and a particle, that there\u0092s a cat in a box somewhere who\u0092s alive and dead at the same time (although if they don\u0092t ever open the box to feed it it\u0092ll eventually just be two different kinds of dead), and that there are stars in the universe billions of years older than the universe itself. I believe in a personal god who cares about me and worries and oversees everything I do. I believe in an impersonal god who set the universe in motion and went off to hang with her girlfriends and doesn\u0092t even know that I\u0092m alive. I believe in an empty and godless universe of casual chaos, background noise, and sheer blind luck. I believe that anyone who says that sex is overrated just hasn\u0092t done it properly. I believe that anyone claims to know what\u0092s going on will lie about the little things too. I believe in absolute honesty and sensible social lies. I believe in a woman\u0092s right to choose, a baby\u0092s right to live, that while all human life is sacred there\u0092s nothing wrong with the death penalty if you can trust the legal system implicitly, and that no one but a moron would ever trust the legal system. I believe life is a game, that life is a cruel joke, and that life is what happens when you\u0092re alive and that you might as well lie back and enjoy it.\"", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LongList?from=Main.TheLongList", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/NeilGaiman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AmericanGods"], "non_media_links": []}
