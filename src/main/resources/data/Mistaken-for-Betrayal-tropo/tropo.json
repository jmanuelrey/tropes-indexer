{"title": "Mistaken for Betrayal", "content": "Say you have two characters. They may mean the world to each other or they may argue a lot but still have begrudging respect for the other. Then, something happens that causes a rift between them of a Et Tu, Brute? sort. Only that's most likely not their fault or rather they didn't intend for it to be perceived as a betrayal. This could also occur between two characters that are not close but still know each other.\n\nThis sometimes involves a character making a drastic decision with noble intentions possibly to help their loved ones, strengthen their friendship with that one character, help the other out etc.\n\nSometimes the assumed betrayal is a prime target for a villain to use to their advantage and compel the one who thinks they were wronged into joining their side and to help them get what they want, be it revenge for the perceived betrayal, etc. Of course, a villain could also have a grudge against the hero, and uses this trope as a deliberate ploy to make them look bad to their loved ones by framing them.\n\nThings may go From Bad to Worse for the other character and because of that they perceive their former friend to blame all because of actions they took that they thought would be beneficial in some fashion or perhaps it was not an action taken by choice.\n\nSometimes this can also happen when a character may be going through a stressful time so they take it out on other characters. They may spread lies and cause drama purely to make themselves feel better and instigate a perceived betrayal between themselves and someone else or between other characters.\n\nA downplayed example could involve a character using another character for their own ends, but they end up Becoming the Mask and genuinely grow to care for them. Therefore, when the other ends up discovering the initial truth they hid behind the mask, they are quick to feel betrayed, much to the mask becoming character's dismay. At that point, the betrayal was no longer intended on their end, hence their becoming the mask.\n\nCan also occur in a Not What It Looks Like situation.\n\nSeems similar to Third-Act Misunderstanding, but set up as an inciting incident for a larger plot rather than a device to resolve the existing plot.\n\nSupertrope of Mistaken for Cheating. See also Stab the Scorpion. May tend to occur due to Poor Communication Kills. Can sometimes come off as some manner of Disproportionate Retribution to the party (as well as the audience) receiving the retribution for the perceived betrayal.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForBetrayal", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/AxisPowersHetalia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Berserk", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/CodeGeass", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FushigiYuugi", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/KatekyoHitmanReborn", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NeonGenesisEvangelion", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PeacemakerKurogane", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PeachGirl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/TokyoGhoul", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/YuriIsMyJob", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Anastasia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/Frozen", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/TheLittleMermaidIIReturnToTheSea", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheLordOfTheRingsTheTwoTowers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Ran", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/HarryPotterAndTheHalfBloodPrince", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/VampireAcademy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheKingLoves", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Awkward", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/QueenOfTheSouth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonQuestBuilders2", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KingdomHearts", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftI", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/HeyArnold", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Rugrats", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPower", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/StevenUniverse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TotallySpies"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EtTuBrute", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FromBadToWorse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecomingTheMask", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotWhatItLooksLike", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThirdActMisunderstanding", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MistakenForCheating", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StabTheScorpion", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoorCommunicationKills", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DisproportionateRetribution", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathBedConfession", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkassFacade", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideForOthersHappiness", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DespairEventHorizon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeNamers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ScreamingWarrior", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CruelAndUnusualDeath", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadPersonConversation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoesMadFromTheRevelation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RapeAsDrama", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrutalHonesty", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/RWBYScars", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DanceOfRomance", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EndlessWinter", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActOfTrueLove", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathbedConfession", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArsonMurderAndJaywalking", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/FinalFantasyVI", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMole", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicSacrifice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebAnimation/RWBY", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpoiledBrat", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FaceHeelTurn", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/SheRaAndThePrincessesOfPowerS3E04MomentOfTruth", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ApocalypseHow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilIsPetty", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainousFriendship", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS2E28MessageReceived"]}
