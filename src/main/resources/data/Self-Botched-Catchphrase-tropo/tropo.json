{"title": "Self-Botched Catchphrase", "content": "It's become a staple of media that characters will have catch phrases. But sometimes, the character himself just can't get it right. It could be a combination of many things, such as they could get distracted mid-quote, or perhaps they're out of practice. Or if it's an origin story for a well-established character, you may expect them to stumble over it the first few times they try to say it.\n\nOften will appear in Hilarious Outtakes, though whether or not it is intentional or just a flubbing of the line attempting to say it right varies, but this trope only deals when it happens In-Universe. In a work where the common tropes tend to get deconstructed, you can expect to see this more than in one where they are played straight. Usually Played for Laughs, though sometimes it could signal a serious Out-of-Character Moment.\n\nNot to be confused with Mangled Catch Phrase for when an impostor is failing at it. Related to Borrowed Catch Phrase, when other characters take a turn at it (though only if they get it wrong). Compare to Subverted Catch Phrase, when a character intentionally changes it up, and Alternate Catchphrase Inflection where they get the words right but not the tone.\n\u2022 In The Incredible Hulk, Bruce Banner tries to tell a bunch of thugs trying to intimidate him that they wouldn't like him when he's angry.

(in English) Wait, that's not right.\n\u2022 In Looney Tunes: Back in Action, it forms a Brick Joke, with Porky Pig complaining about the studio telling him to fix his stutter in the first few minutes of the movie.

He ends up just having to grimace and say \"Go home, folks.\"\n\u2022 Captain Jack Sparrow really only managed to get his catch phrase out properly once, but that doesn't stop him from trying to utter it at every opportunity in the Pirates of the Caribbean series\n\u2022 In Underdog, the titular canine is trying to come up with a catch-phrase but constantly screws them up or makes an awful rhyme, before he settles on the classic \"There's no need to fear, Underdog is here!\"\n\u2022 In Discworld, Cut-me-own-Throat Dibbler manages to botch his catch phrase in Night Watch after Vimes travels 33 years into the past and inadvertently teaches it to him.\n\u2022 In the Doctor Who episode \"The Almost People\", the Doctor takes this Up to Eleven by managing to botch two of his catch phrases at once.

The Abridged Series loves to do this to Kaiba's catchphrase.
