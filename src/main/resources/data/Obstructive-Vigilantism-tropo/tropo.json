{"title": "Obstructive Vigilantism", "content": "Everyone knows that the cops are on your side, and if you let them handle things, then everything will work out, right? Just tell them what you witnessed to get them on the trail, and then the perpetrator will be caught and sentenced. Well, some people think differently. Sometimes, a character might go so far as to lie about what he knows in order to take the law into his own hands. Worse yet, the bad guys might do this, too, and want to settle a score.\n\nWhen it comes to the alleged good guys, this is usually done to prevent a character from being tied to any terrible accident that the criminal encounters. Maybe there's been a crime. The police go around asking people whether they have seen or heard anything, but no one saw anything, no one heard anything, and some people had no idea a crime took place. But after the police finish their investigation and leave, someone goes and tells the local vigilante. Or maybe he is the local vigilante. Another version involves a cop, superhero, military officer or anyone else who is part of some sort of law-enforcement agency who decides to lie to the other members of their group and pretend he knows nothing, in order to kill the perpetrator, instead of having to \"do the right thing\" and give the perpetrator a trial. He might even be somewhat law-abiding, and is simply stalling to get more evidence.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ObstructiveVigilantism", "media_links": ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/PokemonAdventures", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PokemonGoldAndSilver", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathWishII", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheDeparted", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StopOrMyMomWillShoot", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Vigilante", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DeathSentence", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AuntDimity", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BreakingBad", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Dexter", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/LawAndOrder", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JAG", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MaxPayne2TheFallOfMaxPayne", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MassEffect2"], "non_media_links": ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoliceAreUseless", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vigilante", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoHoldsBarredBeatdown", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BlatantLies", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Vigilante", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlotTwist", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhyDontYouJustShootHim", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VigilanteMan", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SerialKillerKiller", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OffOnATechnicality", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotiveDecay", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReplacementScrappy", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SarcasmMode"]}
