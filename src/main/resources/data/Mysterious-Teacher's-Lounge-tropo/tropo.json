{"title": "Mysterious Teacher's Lounge", "content": "In schools, the teacher's lounge is essentially a break room: A place for the faculty to enjoy time away from their duties as teachers of society's next generation. But from the students' perspective, the only thing they know about the Mysterious Teachers Lounge is ... well, that they don't know what exactly lies beyond that locked door.\n\nSo in school settings, expect to see characters occasionally discuss and debate the possibilities of what might be inside. If enough characters get involved, they may even plan to actively break in and discover for themselves what sorts of secrets are hidden therein.\n\nIn more faculty-centric shows, someone may make an issue out of use of the teachers' lounge by support staff; in real life it's usually officially labeled as \"Faculty/Staff Lounge\" or some such even if nobody calls it that, for that reason.\n\nFun fact for today's kids: During the years between teachers not being allowed to smoke in the classroom, and teachers not being allowed to smoke in the school at all, the teachers' lounge reeked of cigs, and the smell was noticeable well into the hallway leading past it.\n\nCompare Wondrous Ladies Room, a similar place in which no man has gone before.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MysteriousTeachersLounge", "media_links": ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/TheFaculty", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/WaysideSchool", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Jennings", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Speak", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ICarly", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NedsDeclassifiedSchoolSurvivalGuide", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/EverybodyHatesChris", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Room101", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/MrD", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Community", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/DestinyFailsUs", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Recess", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PepperAnn", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Arthur", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria"], "non_media_links": ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WondrousLadiesRoom", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ElaborateUndergroundBase", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SchoolNewspaperNewshound", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PuppeteerParasite", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TwoDecadesBehind", "http://destinyfailsus.com/comics/34/#.T74C_cWFnCE", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoubleSubverted", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Magazine/DisneyAdventures", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealAfterAll", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImagineSpot", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging"]}
