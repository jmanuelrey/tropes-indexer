A dead person is dead forever, so I am angry. I am angry and I am hurt that he could not wait for me to wake up, and I don't care if he succeeded now, because if tomorrow he does the same and he fails, then I'll be the one left to pick up the pieces of his scattered corpse to sew them back together, and then I'll have to present it to his family saying that he died bravely, but they would rather have their son back.\"\n\u2022 In Thousand Shinji, when Asuka nearly blows herself up to take down Sandalphon, Shinji got incredibly mad at her. Shinji: (angrily) What the fuck were you thinking? \n\nAsuka: (dazedly) I I did what I had to do, just like how you blew yourself up to take out Shamshel. \n\nShinji: It\u0092s called the \u0091Shinji Suicide Special\u0092 for a reason. \n\nAsuka: (grinning) Well they can call it the \u0091Soryu Suicide Special\u0092 now.\n\u2022 With This Ring: Zatara isn't too impressed by Paul's association with John Constantine, mainly because he knows what happens to people who work with John or owe him favors.

I had a dream Leviathan attacked here and you died.\" \n\n\"I'm here,\" he said. \n\nI ignored him. \"Because of course you went charging into a fight against an Endbringer. Of course you couldn't help yourself, or have the common sense to stick to the sidelines. Of course you had to go and\u0097and get yourself crushed. You dumbass.\" \n\nIt wasn't fair of me to blame him for his own death. Leviathan moved so fast there weren't sidelines to stick to. Still, I'd often thought of the ways things could have gone differently; he could have sought shelter with his family, or stayed paired with someone who could move him from danger, or done anything but try to face off against Leviathan. \n\nBut he wouldn't have had it any other way, and I wouldn't have had him any other way. \n\nDidn't mean he wasn't a dumbass.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngerBornofWorry", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Superman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Supergirl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekTheOriginalSeries", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/HarryPotter", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/SoulEater", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NCIS", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/AlexRider", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/LightNovel/TheFamiliarOfZero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Hellblazer", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DragonAgeInquisition", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/FullmetalAlchemist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MyLittlePonyEquestriaGirls", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Ward"], "non_media_links": ["http://www.fimfiction.net/story/73406/rainbow-in-the-dark", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/RainbowInTheDark", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ACrownOfStars", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheChildOfLove", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheDragonThatWillPierceTheHeavens", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/DoubleAgentVader", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HERZ", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/HigherLearning", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SorkinRelationshipMoment", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/LastChildOfKrypton", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ScarTissue", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheSecondTry", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SupermanOf2499TheGreatConfrontation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/SOE2LoneHeirOfKrypton", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/WhiteDevilOfTheMoon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ChristianHumberReloaded", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/Insontis", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/KyonBigDamnHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Yakuza", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerNullifier", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/EarthAndSky", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/BrokenFacades", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CastFromLifeSpan", "http://www.fanfiction.net/s/9139830/1/Hit-and-Hug", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/MyLittlePonyFriendshipIsMagicS2E19PuttingYourHoofDown", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TookALevelInJerkass", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShrinkingViolet", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/AGrowingAffection", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/Heroes", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaiseHimRightThisTime", "https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9440756/1/Alive", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/ASnowflakeInSpring", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AngstComa", "https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8935062/1/Shards-To-A-Whole", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ItMakesSenseInContext", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LoveInterest", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FieryRedhead", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Polyamory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/CursesPsychonauts", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultFear", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/KitsuneNoKenFistOfTheFox", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TortureTechnician", "https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3518814/1/Hell-is-Other-People", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TheSteepPathAhead", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ZombieApocalypse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThousandShinji", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/OnceMoreWithFeeling", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/CodeGeassThePreparedRebellion", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/WithThisRing", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagiciansAreWizards", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomMagnet", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrickJoke", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EldritchAbomination", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/SugarPlums", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotAfraidToDie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MartyrWithoutACause", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/TwiceUponAnAge", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBrotherInstinct", "https://m.fanfiction.net/s/9184514/4/", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PokemonResetBloodlines", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedHouse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/EscapeFromTheMoon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/YouCanOnlyUseYourOwn", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MyHuntsmanAcademia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PurelyAestheticGlasses", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/MyMasterEd", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/CrimsonAndEmerald", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/TheFlashSentryChronicles", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThePiecesLieWhereTheyFell", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/AGameComesToEquestria", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeggySue", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/Warp"]}
