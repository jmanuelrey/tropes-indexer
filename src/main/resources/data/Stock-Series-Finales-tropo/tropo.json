{"title": "Stock Series Finales", "content": "When a television series isn't cancelled abruptly, writers have time to wrap things up. There seem to be a pretty standard set of types of Series Finales to end on, provided the show's creators have time to plan it out in advance. Most of these can all be mixed together as one wishes. Occasionally, the series may then be Un-Cancelled, and the writers find themselves in a corner.\n\u2022 Villain Death: The main antagonist dies, ideally, by being defeated by the good guy. This may just be the set up for the proper ending which may take on any of the below forms.\n\u2022 Birth: A long-running couple gives birth to their first child.\n\u2022 Back to Normal: In a supernatural or superhero show, the main character is robbed of their supernatural abilities/technologies/friends and goes back to living a normal life (or, at the very least, tells his or her loved ones about his or her powers and decides to go on the run and try to live a normal life while keeping his or her powers under wraps).\n\u2022 Distant Finale: The show flashes forward into the future to show what happened to the main characters.\n\u2022 Gainax Ending: In the end, something happens...and nobody understands what the hell actually happened \u2014 unless the viewer is really good at drawing conclusions and can piece together what happened, and even if a viewer can do that, there would still be loose ends and unanswered questions to plot holes and noodle incidents.\n\u2022 Graduation: If the series centers on kids in school, expect this to be the final episode, especially if it's a high school series. If it's a live action show with aging actors who would resemble graduating high school students by the end of production, then it's all the better. A series centered on college students rarely have this as an ending (as most college shows, whether or not they're spin-offs, don't last) but the graduation ending on college shows does exist.\n\u2022 Grand Finale: Failure Is the Only Option stops being in effect, and with failure suddenly not the only option, the series premise is finally resolved. Since Tropes Are Not Bad, this stock ending can be met with lots of fanfare as the character we root for succeed.\n\u2022 Here We Go Again!: The series ends on a middle note, referencing something from one of the earliest episodes and showing that Nothing Really Changed after all.\n\u2022 Death: The main character(s) die.\n\u2022 Bolivian Army Ending: Like Death, but with specifics left to the viewer's imagination. May or may not include a post credits scene that hints at the characters still being alive.\n\u2022 Last Minute Hookup: The two Will They or Won't They? characters finally get together.\n\u2022 Moving: The cast or the principal stars move away. This is usually the case in family sitcoms, and some that end this way are Clip Show episodes. May go hand in hand with a graduation ending as the high school students go their separate ways.\n\u2022 Walk Into the Sunset and And the Adventure Continues: The series ends with the characters going off on another adventure. This ending is the one ripe for fans to either write fanfiction about what happens after the series ends or fans to pester the show creators into continuing the series.\n\u2022 Wedding: The main couple or a pair of supporting characters are married off.\n\u2022 \"Where Are They Now?\" Epilogue: Sometimes used in conjunction with other ending tropes (particularly the \"Graduation\" ending, the \"Moving Out\" ending, and the Distant Finale ending); what happens to the characters in the future is summarized either in a captioned statement or a voiceover narration, usually on a person-by-person basis.\n\u2022 The entire series is revealed to be All Just a Dream (whether it's from the mind of someone dying, someone unconscious/in a coma, or from someone sleeping). Often, this is the bad writers' way out of a series or done to retcon anything considered Fanon Discontinuity. If you're a series writer, use caution and sufficient foreshadowing before using this.\n\u2022 Final Battle: An action/adventure series usually ends with this. May be a precursor to any of the above.\n\nAs you might expect, this is an ending trope. Expect unmarked spoilers.\n\u2022 To no one's surprise, Lord Voldemort died at the end of the last Harry Potter book.\n\u2022 At the end of both Sabriel and Abhorsen, the Sealed Evil in a Can is sealed up once more, and the world is safe.\n\u2022 By the end of Inuyasha Naraku is indeed finally destroyed.\n\u2022 Static Shock had a cure found for the Bang Babies in its finale. Fortunately, thanks to another exposure to the Bang Baby gas, Static keeps his powers, and even becomes stronger than ever.\n\u2022 The Secret World of Alex Mack also found a cure in its finale. However, it's left up in the air if Alex actually takes it or not.\n\u2022 Star Trek: The Next Generation ended with a future screen.\n\u2022 Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Enterprise include glimpses of the future of their characters.\n\u2022 After a lengthy battle that finally resolves the Human-Cylon war, the series finale of Battlestar Galactica ends with a look at the fate of all the characters before jumping ahead several thousand years into the future.\n\u2022 The Mad About You finale jumps the show 20+ years into the future, presenting the Buchmans' now-adult daughter Mabel showing what became of her family and the rest of the characters.\n\u2022 The infamous ending of Digimon Adventure 02. In this ending, the cast is shown as adults, with each of them having kids and a nice job, along with their Digimon partners.\n\u2022 The rather original finale to Codename: Kids Next Door is a flashback episode intercut with interviews with the kids as middle-aged adults (played by live action actors).\n\u2022 The epilogue to the final Harry Potter book, which shows Harry and Ginny and Ron and Hermione being married couples who see their sons and daughters off at Kings Cross Station.\n\u2022 Six Feet Under ends with flash forwards to the eventual death of every still living character.\n\u2022 Babylon 5 did at least two distant endings. One involved glimpses of humanity's future up to a million years ahead, then a more conventional version many episodes later, featuring the fate of the principal characters.\n\u2022 China Beach has the surviving veterans reunite and visit the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington D.C.\n\u2022 Scrubs ends with J.D. imagining one possible future for the group, complete with marriages, kids, and Christmases spent together. JD: And who's to say this isn't what happens? Who can tell me that my fantasies won't come true...just this once.\n\nFailure Is the Only Option...Not\n\u2022 The Fugitive: Richard Kimble finally confronts the One-Armed Man and manages to clear his name for the murder of his wife.\n\u2022 Star Trek: Voyager: The USS Voyager finally made it home after 7 years of failed attempts.\n\u2022 When they thought that Stargate SG-1 was ending, the producers wrote a story line that featured the final defeat of both the Replicators and the System Lords.\n\u2022 Ed, Edd n Eddy has the titular characters finally be accepted by the rest of the neighborhood kids in the movie.\n\u2022 In the relatively obscure cartoon Dogstar, The main characters are given the device that allows them to summon the missing titular ship that contains all the world's dogs that got lost after civilization migrated to a new planet after they destroyed Earth by pollution. Afterwards, the Big Bad inadvertently destroys it, and they have to migrate back to the newly repaired Earth.\n\u2022 Adrian Monk finally solves his wife's murder at the end of the eighth season.\n\u2022 Good Times has the main characters finally having success at various endeavors they had been struggling with during the show's run.\n\u2022 Kim Possible ended its Post-Script Season with Kim and gang's graduation from high school.\n\u2022 The Suite Life on Deck: \"Graduation On Deck\" which ends both Zack and Cody and On Deck.\n\u2022 The Steve Harvey Show: Romeo, Lydia, and Bullethead graduate from high school. This was originally supposed to be the final episode, but thanks to Executive Meddling, it became the next-to-last episode. However, it is shown as the final episode in syndication.\n\u2022 Leave It to Beaver: Although not shown onscreen in this episode, many references are made to Beaver graduating from eighth grade (i.e., entering high school in the fall) and Wally graduating from high school (and getting ready to enter college).\n\u2022 House of Anubis: The Movie, Touchstone of Ra, took place during graduation and is at least assumed to be the finale, with all the students graduating from the Academy of Adventure.\n\u2022 In-Universe on the show Sing it Loud! for Liv and Maddie, which ends with Liv's character Stephanie Einstein graduating.\n\u2022 Star Trek: Voyager also has the birth of Official Couple Tom and B'Elanna's first child, Miral Paris.\n\u2022 Farscape has Aeryn pregnant throughout the final season, although for a time in the Miniseries wrap up the baby is carried by Rygel. The baby is born in the miniseries (after making its way back to Aeryn).\n\u2022 Chandler and Monica's adoptive children were born in the Friends series finale.\n\u2022 Amen ended with the birth of Thelma and Reuben's son.\n\u2022 Niles and Daphne's son is born in the final episode of Frasier\n\u2022 Mama's Family ends with the birth of Tiffany Thelma Harper, Vint and Naomi's daughter.\n\u2022 Lost ends with most of the cast reuniting in a self-created afterlife, then exiting through a glowing door together.\n\u2022 Every Joss Whedon series generally kills off at least one major character in the finale.\n\u2022 Robin Hood ended with its eponymous character dying and getting a Together in Death scene with Marian.\n\nHere We Go Again!\n\u2022 Dai-Guard ends with the characters (and presumably Japan) having accepted that the giant monsters, Heterodynes, are a natural disaster, akin to hurricanes and earthquakes, so will just continue doing their best to save lives. After taking out the biggest Heterodyne yet, of course.\n\u2022 The final Seinfeld episode finds Jerry and George having the exact same conversation that they were having at the beginning of the show's very first episode.\n\u2022 The infamous ending to Stephen King's The Dark Tower series, where (after a full page of the author urging the reader to stop right there because endings can never satisfy the buildup a story creates) Roland finally enters the Tower, only to find that it resets him back to where he started in Book 1 of the adventure (albeit with the implication he has a chance of getting it right this time).\n\u2022 The animated series Mighty Max ends with Big Bad Skull Master killing all the supporting characters, only to be defeated by Max at the end in a move which teleports Max all the way back to the first episode of the series (although, as he retains his full memories of the entire series, presumably he has a chance of doing better this time round).\n\u2022 The canonical ending to the final episode of Red vs. Blue is a scene that directly mirrors the first scene from the first episode of the series.\n\u2022 The end of Mystery Science Theater 3000 has Mike and the bots now on Earth and living in an apartment... where they now watch bad movies all on their own choice. The film in question they're watching at the end? The Crawling Eye, the same film watched in the first official episode of the series.\n\u2022 The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air ended with Uncle Phil's family moving to a new house.\n\u2022 iCarly ended with Carly moving to Italy with her father.\n\u2022 Frasier has the titular character leaving Seattle, ostensibly to take a job in San Francisco. In the final moments of the show, however, it's revealed he instead took a flight to Chicago to meet up with his love interest.\n\u2022 Fraggle Rock ends with Doc moving to the desert to accompany Ned Shimmelfinney (or, in the UK version, the lighthouse getting automated and B.J. becoming the caretaker of a castle), sad that he has to leave the Fraggles now that he's learned of their existence. It turns out Fraggle Rock exists there too.\n\u2022 In the last episode of Friends, Chandler and Monica move to the suburbs, and it's mentioned that all of them have lived in that apartment at some point. (Phoebe was established as having shared it with Monica prior to the first episode; Ross gets a retcon that he stayed there for a while when his and Monica's grandmother still lived there.)\n\u2022 The Series Fauxnale of Scrubs has J.D. moving to a different hospital. (Then he moves back to Sacred Heart when it gets Un-Canceled, only it's not the same Sacred Heart any more.)\n\u2022 Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, whose producers knew they weren't getting a movie, has this happen to many of the characters following the Final Battle \u2014 Sisko is taken up to join the Prophets, Odo returns to the Great Link, O'Brien takes a teaching job at Starfleet Academy, Worf becomes the Federation ambassador to the Klingon homeworld, Garak remains on Cardassia after the war, and Rom goes off to become the Grand Nagus. Kira, Bashir, Ezri Dax, and Quark remain on the station.\n\u2022 Broad City ends with Abbi moving to Colorado to focus on her art.\n\u2022 My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic ended with Twilight moving back to Canterlot and becoming the new ruler of Equestria.\n\nWill They or Won't They?\n\u2022 Kim Possible ended originally with the Last Minute Hookup of Kim and Ron before the show was Un-Canceled.\n\u2022 Danny Phantom ended with the Last Minute Hookup as well. And unlike the above, it didn't get Un-Canceled.\n\u2022 The Friends finale ended with Ross and Rachel getting back together. For good, this time.\n\u2022 Family Matters ended with Urkel finally getting his girl, Laura, when they share a kiss after Urkel almost dies in outer space.\n\u2022 How I Met Your Mother ends when Ted realizing that he really did love Robin the whole time and goes to her apartment with the symbol of their love, the blue french horn.\n\u2022 Neon Genesis Evangelion is the most infamous, though the actual ending is relatively easy to understand if you take a College Course on Philosophy, Psychology, and/or Religious Studies.\n\u2022 The Prisoner (1967): In the end, everyone goes crazy, wears weird costumes, and sings Dem Bones all day long. Would have been the Trope Namer if Gainax wasn't so infamously divisive at endings.\n\u2022 Mystery Science Theater 3000's first finale (when Comedy Central had canceled them, and the Sci-Fi Channel hadn't yet Un-Canceled them) has Mike and the bots fly the Satellite of Love out to the edge of the universe, where they all ascend as beings of pure energy. Meanwhile, Dr. Forester reenacts the notoriously confusing ending of 2001: A Space Odyssey (with the Monolith replaced by a giant VHS tape labeled \"the worst movie ever\") and reverts to a baby, and his mother Pearl takes the opportunity to Raise Him Right This Time.\n\u2022 Parks and Recreation has had so many series fauxnales that several episodes fall into some of these tropes. \"Lil Sebastian\" (Season 3 finale) falls into the And the Adventure Continues trope, with Leslie thinking about running for city council, Tom quitting his job, and Ron's ex-wife Tammy 1 returning. \"Leslie and Ben\" falls into the wedding trope, with Leslie and Ben's wedding. \"Moving Up\" is a Distant Finale, with a 3-year Time Skip. The actual series finale is a \"Where Are They Now?\" Epilogue.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockSeriesFinales", "media_links":
