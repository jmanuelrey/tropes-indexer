{"title": "Minion Manipulated into Villainy", "content": "A minion who is extremely loyal to their dark master. Perhaps they firmly believes in their master's cause due to a past tragedy that made them see their point of view. Maybe they lost everything and their master aided them in their time of need. Whatever the case, their Undying Loyalty knows no bounds and they'll do whatever they can to fulfill their boss' ambitions. But then it's revealed that their boss had been the one who had orchestrated their Dark and Troubled Past to drive them into their clutches. Their boss had played them!\n\nThis is a cruel tactic by Chessmasters to gain Unwitting Pawns. Whether they're the one who destroyed one's Doomed Hometown, orchestrated their ostracism from society, or took away that person's loved ones, afterwards they would appear to their victim as a kind benefactor who offered them revenge, a chance to regain what they lost, or an idea to make the world a better place, with the unknowing sap becoming their most loyal servant out of gratitude and debt.\n\nWhy the villain chooses that particular person to manipulate varies. They could possess certain skills that the villain needs. They could be the most easily manipulated person the villain found. Or perhaps the villain just picked them at random; anyone would've sufficed and this poor schmuck just happened to have the bad luck of being chosen.\n\nNaturally, when the servant finds out that their life had been ruined and their ideals had been planted into them by the one person they thought they could trust, expect things like a Roaring Rampage of Revenge, the servant screaming You Monster!, and perhaps pulling a Heel\u0096Face Turn to aid the heroes in defeating the villain.\n\nWhether or not the servant's rebellion leads to The Dog Bites Back varies. Sometimes, it can lead to Redemption Equals Death. Other times, the servant manages to survive and goes off to start rebuilding their life the right way.\n\nFor cruelty, however, the servant might not even get the chance to fight back against the one who destroyed their life, experiencing a Heel\u0096Face Door-Slam when they attempt to rebel, either by a You Have Outlived Your Usefulness once their master's secret is out, or a Villain Override, the villain destroying what independence they had left and turning them into a mindless servant to ensure their continued loyalty.\n\nSome times, a villain isn't even bothered by the fact that their secret has been revealed; they might even decide to reveal it themselves as part of a Break Them by Talking speech, mocking the servant's inability to figure the truth out, calling them a fool that they was able to easily manipulate, and just plain rubbing it in their face what they did. Whether or not this backfires on the villain varies.\n\nThis is one possible path that The Corrupter may take. Often a dark twist on Because You Were Nice to Me. Sometimes the case for a character who was Recruited from the Gutter. Compare Forced into Evil and Trapped in Villainy where a servant isn't so subtly made to do their boss' bidding. Also compare Poison-and-Cure Gambit based on the method of the villain's manipulation. Contrast Brainwashed and Crazy where a villain uses more direct methods to turn a person into their servant. Reforged into a Minion has a similar situation, where a villain recruits someone who is near death, though the two can overlap if it's revealed the villain was behind the events that nearly got the guy killed. May overlap with Treacherous Advisor or Evil Mentor.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MinionManipulatedIntoVillainy", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/MagicalGirlLyricalNanohaStrikers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Naruto", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NarutoTheMovieLegendOfTheStoneOfGelel", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/YuGiOh", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOh5Ds", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/YuGiOhZexal", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Chinaman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Deathstroke", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/BlackMoonChronicles", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/WonderWoman", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/PlanetHulk", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/FaustLoveOfTheDamned", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWars", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/StreetFighter", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/StarWarsLegends", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheThrawnTrilogy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/CiaphasCain", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/BurnNotice", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/JukenSentaiGekiranger", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Nikita", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Supernatural", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Warhammer40000", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DawnOfWar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MapleStory", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftII", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/StarcraftIIWingsOfLiberty", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWorldEndsWithYou", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ApocalypticHorseplay", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/ElGoonishShive"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkAndTroubledPast", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheChessmaster", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnwittingPawn", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedHometown", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThenLetMeBeEvil", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouKilledMyFather", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IOweYouMyLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouMonster", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDogBitesBack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEqualsDeath", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedemptionEarnsLife", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceDoorSlam", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouHaveOutlivedYourUsefulness", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainOverride", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindRape", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakThemByTalking", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilGloating", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheCorrupter", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BecauseYouWereNiceToMe", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RecruitedFromTheGutter", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ForcedIntoEvil", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInVillainy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoisonAndCureGambit", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainwashedAndCrazy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MindControl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReforgedIntoAMinion", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TreacherousAdvisor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilMentor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DarkMagicalGirl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SummonMagic", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UtopiaJustifiesTheMeans", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenHero", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BatmanGambit", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunctuatedForEmphasis", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YOUMONSTER", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuirkyMiniBossSquad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BigBad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReforgedIntoAMinion", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FakeMemories", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FalseFlagOperation", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SorcerousOverlord", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeelFaceTurn", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMindControl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroismAddict", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DealWithTheDevil", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilPlan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DumbMuscle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndyingLoyalty", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BreakTheHaughty", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/XanatosSpeedChess", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StockholmSyndrome", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmazonBrigade", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GodEmperor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeKnowsTooMuch", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SuicideByCop", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UsedToBeASweetKid", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheDragon", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DrunkOnTheDarkSide", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RoaringRampageOfRevenge", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoodleImplements", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Shinigami", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Psychopomp", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PunchClockVillain", "http://www.egscomics.com/index.php?id=1477"]}
