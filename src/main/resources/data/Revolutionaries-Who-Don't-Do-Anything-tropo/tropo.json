{"title": "Revolutionaries Who Don't Do Anything", "content": "Stan: Alright, that's it! No more briefing! From now on, we take action!\n\nJudith: (breaking into the room) They've arrested Brian! They've dragged him off, they're gonna crucify him!\n\nWhen people think of a rebel, a radical, or a revolutionary, usually the first things that pop into their head are a Bomb Throwing Anarchist or a hero of the working class, someone actively overthrowing the government, giving away food, dismantling....something. You know, someone doing something to change things in drastic ways.\n\nThese guys are not that. Maybe they spend more time squabbling amongst themselves than fighting the Bourgeoisie, maybe they're too concerned with analyzing theory, maybe they decided forcing people to adopt their way of life goes against their moral code, maybe they're not actually revolutionaries at all, maybe they're only using 'The Cause' for their own personal benefit. More often than not they just wanna look cool. Whatever the case, they just don't do anything super productive, even when given an opportunity to do so. Most option their involvement in politics usually amounts to posturing. Often times in their heads they may see themselves as a part of La R\u00e9sistance (and more comedic examples of these do fall into this trope), though sometimes they are fully aware they aren't actually doing anything and are fine with that. Commonly, these characters may be students.\n\nA very common trait of the New-Age Retro Hippie and the Bourgeois Bohemian. They differ from the Rule-Abiding Rebel in that not only may they very well break the law and be genuinely rebellious, they also usually have a political goal in mind rather than just playing at being a rebel. Sometimes they may be a Soapbox Sadie but usually that involves more actual activism. In some cases this may be a result of The Man Is Sticking It to the Man. Portrayals can range from affectionate Self-Parody to active straw-manning, and everything in between. Please note that a character must actually fancy themselves a revolutionary or a radical who will end the status quo or overthrow the government, a character simply showing verbal support for a radical movement but not actively claiming to be a part of it does not count. It also doesn't count if they do actually do something but for the wrong reasons, or are upset with the final outcome.\n\nThis trope should also not be confused with Pirates Who Don't Do Anything, which refers to when a character has a job they are never seen doing. This trope is for people claiming to belong to a radical group but who never do anything radical.\n\nWhile this is a thing in real life, for very obvious reasons No Real Life Examples, Please!.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RevolutionariesWhoDontDoAnything", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonsLifeOfBrian", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Persepolis", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/ComicBook/Runaways", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/AAPessimal", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MontyPythonsLifeOfBrian", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/HailCaesar", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/Discworld", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/NotTheNineOClockNews", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheYoungOnes", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/StarTrekDeepSpaceNine", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Yonderland", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/ThankGodYoureHere", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/CitizenSmith", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Rent", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Deponia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VisualNovel/BecauseWereHere", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/FritzTheCat", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheAmazingWorldOfGumball", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/TheBoondocks", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/AmericanDad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Daria", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/InvaderZim"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BombThrowingAnarchist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeAreStrugglingTogether", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NavelGazing", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ActualPacifist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CoolPeopleRebelAgainstAuthority", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaResistance", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NewAgeRetroHippie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BourgeoisBohemian", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RuleAbidingRebel", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapboxSadie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheManIsStickingItToTheMan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SelfParody", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawCharacter", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NotSoWellIntentionedExtremist", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PiratesWhoDontDoAnything", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Administrivia/NoRealLifeExamplesPlease", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MotherRussiaMakesYouStrong", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoapboxSadie", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Discworld/ReaperMan", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurZombiesAreDifferent", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Discworld/NightWatch", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Discworld/InterestingTimes", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpannerInTheWorks", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS15E4TheSunMakers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MegaCorp", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS18E4StateOfDecay", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurVampiresAreDifferent", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VampireMonarch", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS28E5RiseOfTheCybermen", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/DoctorWhoS28E6TheAgeOfSteel", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EvilOverlord", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/CheGuevara", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FantasyCounterpartCulture", "https://thehardtimes.net/culture/punk-upset-constant-anti-capitalism-rants-result-in-third-consecutive-birthday-with-no-gifts/", "https://thehardtimes.net/culture/5-powerful-ways-to-help-end-child-detention-without-getting-too-involved-youre-a-busy-person-we-get-it/"]}
