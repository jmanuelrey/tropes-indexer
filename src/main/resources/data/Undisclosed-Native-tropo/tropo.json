{"title": "Undisclosed Native", "content": "This is the cast member without a place of origin. No one knows where they came from and everyone has a theory about where they are truly from. They are all wrong. This character is usually from some small country in Eastern Europe or from a small island in the South Pacific, but they aren't telling until the summer trip episode. This character is usually the prince/princess or other nobility from Undisclosed-istan.\n\nThese have an increased chance of Laser-Guided Amnesia: you can't disclose where you came from if you can't remember where you came from.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UndisclosedNative", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/LoveHina", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/Yotsuba", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/NadiaTheSecretOfBlueWater", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/TheBelgariad", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MobyDick", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/That70sShow", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Toys/Bionicle", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/EdEddNEddy"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ruritania", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeCodifier", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HighFantasy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LightIsGood", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LaserGuidedAmnesia", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AmbiguouslyBrown"]}
