Perhaps so they can sow wild oats or learn important lessons about their partner, or on the opposite end of the scale, who to trust with an unattended drinks. Sometimes these last minute hookups are used to get the other party to realize the error of their delays. Often, this is the very first relationship in a long time for the flinging party, since they've been so entrapped by the ongoing will-they-or-won't-they nonsense.\n\u2022 Cheers: In episode \"One for the Book\", a seminary student named Kevin, who is one day away from a life of chastity and a vow of silence as a monk, comes into the bar to experience a night of drinking and fun before going away to the monastery forever.
