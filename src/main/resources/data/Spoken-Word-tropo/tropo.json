During the 1960s and 1970s in particular, this technique was often used in film musicals to allow popular actors to star in them despite a total or near-total lack of singing ability. It is also used in theatre when production schedules simply do not allow time for proper rehearsal of choral numbers.\n\u2022 Rex Harrison in My Fair Lady and Doctor Dolittle. He dubbed the technique \"Sing-Speak\".\n\u2022 Lorne Greene in Bonanza performs the theme's lyrics this way.\n\u2022 John DiMaggio, voicing Gorilla Grodd in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \"Mayhem of the Music Meister!\", uses this technique.\n\u2022 Just about everyone in the film version of Man of La Mancha, which is fortunate since none of the stars were even tolerable singers.\n\u2022 Robert Preston as Professor Harold Hill in The Music Man.\n\u2022 Used on The Muppet Show by any guest star who couldn't actually sing.\n\u2022 The musical Camelot does this quite a bit.\n\u2022 \"All I Wanna Do Is Play Cards\" by Corb Lund.\n\u2022 R.E.M. did this a couple of times, with \"Belong\" and \"Blue\".", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpokenWord", "media_links": ["https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/MyFairLady", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DoctorDolittle", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Bonanza", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheBraveAndTheBold", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/ManOfLaMancha", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/JohnnyCash", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/TheMusicMan", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/TheMuppetShow", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Theatre/Camelot", "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Music/REM"], "non_media_links": []}
