{"title": "Shy Shelled Animal", "content": "\"You've probably heard this expression: 'He was so afraid, he rolled into a ball, like an armadillo!'\"\n\nAnimals that have hard shells for protection\u2014turtles, armadillos, snails, crabs, etc.\u2014have a tendency to be depicted as timid, cowardly or nervous characters. While these shells exist in real life as a means of protection from predators, fiction tends to associate them with traits like shyness and introversion. In fact, this is probably the origin of the expression \"come out of your shell\" to describe someone overcoming their shyness.\n\nSubtrope of Animal Stereotypes. For other tropes related to shelled animals, see Removable Shell and Shell Backpack.\n\u2022 Sebastian the crab from The Little Mermaid is the uptight, Nervous Wreck servant of King Triton. \"My nerves are shot! This is a catastrophe! What would her father say? I'll tell you what her father'd say. He'd say he's gonna kill himself a CRAB, that's what her father'd say!\"\n\u2022 Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers: The Troubadour is a cartoon turtle who gets nervous around some characters, like his apparent boss Mr. Narrator, and Captain Pete. He sometimes literally hides in his shell from them.\n\u2022 Toby Turtle from Disney's Robin Hood is often seen hiding in his shell when he feels scared. One such example is when Skippy tells him that he's going to get the arrow he shot back from Maid Marian's castle, fearing that Skippy will face execution if Maid Marian spots him.", "url": "https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShyShelledAnimal", "media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DillonsRollingWesternTheLastRanger", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Anime/KirbyRightBackAtYa", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/TheLittleMermaid", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/MickeyDonaldGoofyTheThreeMusketeers", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Disney/RobinHood", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DiddyKongRacing", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/DillonsRollingWesternTheLastRanger", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Insaniquarium", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheLegendaryStarfy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/PaperMarioTheThousandYearDoor", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/SlyCooper", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Bubsy", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/RockosModernLife"], "non_media_links": ["/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AnimalStereotypes", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RemovableShell", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ShellBackpack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SycophanticServant", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ThisTimeRound", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AlternateTooniverse", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NervousWreck", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Discworld/SmallGods", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheMindIsAPlaythingOfTheBody", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasqueradeBall", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RollingAttack", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JerkWithAHeartOfGold", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DudeInDistress", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSquid", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CowardlyLion", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Adorkable", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MissionControl", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/KevinAndKell", "https://kevinandkell.com/1997/kk0211.html", "https://kevinandkell.com/2012/kk0713.html", "https://kevinandkell.com/2016/kk0208.html", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoreThanMeetsTheEye", "https://kevinandkell.com/2016/kk0507.html", "https://kevinandkell.com/2016/kk0509.html", "https://kevinandkell.com/2016/kk0506.html", "https://kevinandkell.com/2016/kk0504.html", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NerdGlasses", "/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NiceGuy"]}
